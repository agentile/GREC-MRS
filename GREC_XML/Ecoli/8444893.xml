<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">The Fur protein, which regulates iron uptake in Escherichia coli, also represses the biosynthesis of the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD).</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">A strain of E. coli bearing a lacZ fusion to the aerobactin operon was used to compare the metal specificities of the regulation of MnSOD and of aerobactin by Fur.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Iron, but not manganese, acted as a corepressor of the Fur-dependent inhibition of MnSOD biosynthesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">The iron-mediated inhibition of MnSOD biosynthesis was dependent upon an intact fur locus, indicating that the effect of iron is mediated by the fur gene product.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">The suppression of the accumulation of MnSOD by iron, but not by manganese, was not due to destabilization of the MnSOD polypeptide by iron.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">Thus this effect of iron was also seen in a sodA::lacZ operon fusion in which <term sem="SPAN" id="T1" lex="the_production">the production</term> of beta-galactosidase was regulated by <term sem="Promoter" id="T2" lex="the_sodA_promoter">the sodA promoter</term>.</sentence>

<clue>Thus this effect of iron was also seen in a sodA::lacZ operon fusion in which the production of beta-galactosidase was <clueType>regulated</clueType> by the sodA promoter.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S9">In contrast, both iron and manganese served as corepressors of aerobactin biosynthesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">It thus appears that the effectiveness of specific metal cations to act as corepressors with Fur varies with <term sem="Gene" id="T3" lex="the_gene">the gene</term> being regulated by <term sem="Protein_Complex" id="T4" lex="the_Fur-metal_complex">the Fur-metal complex</term>.</sentence>
