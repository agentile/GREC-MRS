<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">MOTIVATION: Current methods for identifying sequence specific binding sites in DNA sequence using position specific weight matrices are limited in both sensitivity and specificity.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">Double strand DNA helix exhibits sequence dependent variations in conformation.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Interactions between macromolecules result from complementarity of the two tertiary structures.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">We hypothesize that this conformational variation plays a role in transcription factor binding site recognition, and that the use of this structure information will improve the predictive power of transcription factor binding site models.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">RESULTS: Conformation models for the sequence dependence of DNA helix distortion have been developed.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">Using our conformational models, we defined a tertiary structure template for the met operon repressor MetJ binding site.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">Both naturally occurring sites and precursor binding sites identified through in vitro selection were used as the basis for template definition.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">The conformational model appears to recognize features of protein binding sites that are distinct from the features recognized by primary sequence based profiles.</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">Combining the conformational model and primary sequence profile yields a hybrid model with improved discriminatory power compared with either the conformational model or sequence profile alone.</sentence>
<sentence id="S12">Using our hybrid model, we searched the E.coli genome.</sentence>
<sentence id="S13">We are able to identify the documented MetJ sites in the promoter regions of metA, metB, metC, metR and metF.</sentence>
<sentence id="S14">In addition, we find several novel loci with characteristics suggesting that they are functional MetJ repressor binding sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="S15">Novel MetJ binding sites are found upstream of the metK gene, as well as upstream of a gene, <term sem="Gene" id="T1" lex="abc">abc</term>, a gene that encodes for <term sem="Sub_Unit" id="T2" lex="a_component"><term sem="SPAN" id="T3" lex="a_component_of_a_multifunction_transporter">a component of a multifunction transporter</term></term> which may transport amino acids across the membrane.</sentence>

<clue>Novel MetJ binding sites are found upstream of the metK gene, as well as upstream of a gene, abc, a gene that <clueType>encodes</clueType> for a component of a multifunction transporter which may transport amino acids across the membrane.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S16">The false positive rate is significantly lower than the sequence profile method.</sentence>
<sentence id="S17">AVAILABILITY: The programs of implementation of this algorithm are available upon request.</sentence>
<sentence id="S18">The list of crystal structures used for compiling the mean base step parameters of DNA is available by anonymous ftp at http://stateslab.wustl.edu/pub/helix/StructureList.</sentence>
