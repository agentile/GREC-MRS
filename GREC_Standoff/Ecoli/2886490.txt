Fimbrial phase variation in Escherichia coli: dependence on integration host factor and homologies with other site-specific recombinases. 
Expression of fimA, the structural gene for type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli, is phase variable. Significant homologies were identified between the recombinases which control fimbrial phase variation, FimB and FimE, and the integrase class of site-specific recombinases. Normal expression of fimA was shown to require the integration host factor (IHF). Mutations in either the himA-or the himD (hip) gene, which encode the alpha and beta subunits of IHF, respectively, prevented phase variation and locked expression of fimA in either the &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; phase. In addition, both himA and himD lesions caused a sevenfold reduction in expression of a phi(fimA-lacZ) operon fusion in strains in which fimA was locked in the on phase. Thus, IHF plays a dual role in controlling fimA expression: it is required both for inversion of the fimA control region and for efficient expression from the fimA promoter. A mechanism by which IHF may exert control over fimA expression is discussed.
