Regulation of Escherichia coli K-12 hexuronate system genes: exu regulon 
Two types of Escherichia coli K-12 regulatory mutants, partially or totally negative for the induction of the five catabolic enzymes (uronic isomerase, uxaC; altronate oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: uxaB; mannonate hydrolyase, uxuA) and the transport system (exuT) of the hexuronate-inducible pathway, were isolated and analyzed enzymatically. Hexuronate-catabolizing revertants of the negative mutants showed a constitutive synthesis for some or all of these enzymes. Negative and constitutive mutations were localized in the same genetic locus, called exuR, and the following order for the markers situated between the min 65 and 68 was determined: argG--exuR--exuT--uxaC--uxaA--tolC. The enzymatic characterization of the pleiotropic negative and constitutive mutants of the exuR gene suggests that the exuR regulatory gene product exerts a specific and total control on the three exuT, uszB, and uxaC-uxaA operons of the galacturonate pathway and a partial control on the uxuA-uxuB operon of the glucuronate pathway. The analysis of diploid strains conatining both the wild type and a negative or constitutive allele of the exuR gene, as well as the analysis of thermosensitive mutants of the exuR gene, was in agreement with a negative regulatory mechanism for the control of the hexuronate system.
