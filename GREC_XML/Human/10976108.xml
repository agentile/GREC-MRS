<sentence id="S3">RET finger protein (RFP) belongs to the large B-box RING finger protein family and is known to become oncogenic by fusion with RET tyrosine kinase.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">Although RFP is reported to be a nuclear protein that is present in the nuclear matrix, its function is largely unknown.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Here we show that <term sem="Protein" id="T3" lex="RFP">RFP</term> interacts with <term sem="Enhancer" id="T4" lex="Enhancer_of_Polycomb">Enhancer of Polycomb</term> (EPC) and <term sem="SPAN" id="T5" lex="strongly">strongly</term> represses <term sem="Gene" id="T6" lex="the_gene">the gene</term> transcription.</sentence>

<sentence id="S6">Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the coiled-coil domain of RFP was associated with the EPcA domain and the carboxyl-terminal region of EPC.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">In addition, both proteins were co-precipitated from the lysates of human cells and mostly colocalized in the nucleus.</sentence>

<sentence id="S9">The coiled-coil domain of RFP and the carboxyl-terminal region of EPC were most important for the repressive activity of each protein, whereas the EPcA domain had the transcription activating ability that is unique as the Polycomb group protein function.</sentence>
