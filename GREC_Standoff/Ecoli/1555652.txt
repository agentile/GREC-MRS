Escherichia coli leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) controls lysyl-tRNA synthetase expression. 
Using random Tn10 insertion mutagenesis, we isolated an Escherichia coli mutant strain affected in the regulation of lysU, the gene encoding the inducible form of lysyl-tRNA synthetase. The transposon giving rise to the altered expression of lysU was found inserted within lrp. The latter gene codes for the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) which mediates a global response of the bacterium to leucine. An involvement of Lrp in the regulation of lysU was searched for by using a lysU-lacZ operon fusion. inactivation of lrp causes an increased activity of the lysU promoter, whatever the growth conditions assayed, (ii) insertion of a wild-type lrp gene into a multi-copy plasmid significantly reduces lysU expression, and (iii) sensitivity of the lysU promoter to the presence of leucine in the growth medium is abolished in the lrp context.
