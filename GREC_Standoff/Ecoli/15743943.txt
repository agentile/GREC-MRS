Function and expression of an N-acetylneuraminic acid-inducible outer membrane channel in Escherichia coli. 
The Escherichia coli yjhA (renamed nanC) gene encodes a protein of the KdgM family of outer membrane-specific channels. It is transcribed divergently from fimB, a gene involved in the site-specific inversion of the region controlling transcription of the fimbrial structural genes but is separated from it by one of the largest intergenic regions in E. coli. We show that nanC expression is induced by N-acetylneuraminic acid and modulated by N-acetylglucosamine. This regulation occurs via the NanR and NagC regulators, which also control fimB expression. nanC expression is also activated by the regulators cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein, OmpR, and CpxR. When the NanC protein was reconstituted into liposomes, it formed channels with a conductance of 450 pS at positive potential and 300 to 400 pS at negative potential in 800 mM KCl. The channels had a weak anionic selectivity. In an ompR background, where the general porins OmpF and OmpC are absent, NanC is required for growth of E. coli on N-acetylneuraminic acid as the sole carbon source. All these results suggest that NanC is an N-acetylneuraminic acid outer membrane channel protein.
