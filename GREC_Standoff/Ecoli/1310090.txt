Positive and negative control of ompB transcription in Escherichia coli by cyclic AMP and the cyclic AMP receptor protein. 
The ompB operon encodes OmpR and EnvZ, two proteins that are necessary for the expression and osmoregulation of the OmpF and OmpC porins in Escherichia coli. We have used in vitro and in vivo experiments to show that cyclic AMP and the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) directly regulate ompB. ompB expression in an ompB-lacZ chromosomal fusion strain was increased two- to fivefold when cells were grown in medium containing poor carbon sources or with added cyclic AMP. In vivo primer extension analysis indicated that this control is complex and involves both positive and negative effects by cyclic AMP-CRP on multiple ompB promoters. In vitro footprinting showed that cyclic AMP-CRP binds to a 34-bp site centered at -53 and at -75 in relation to the start sites of the major transcripts that are inhibited and activated, respectively, by this complex. Site-directed mutagenesis of the crp binding site provided evidence that this site is necessary for the in vivo regulation of ompB expression by cyclic AMP. Control of the ompB operon by cyclic AMP-CRP may account for the observed regulation of the formation of OmpF and OmpC by this complex (N.W. Scott and C.R. Harwood, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 9:95-98, 1980).
