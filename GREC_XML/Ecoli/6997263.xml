<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">Two types of Escherichia coli K-12 regulatory mutants, partially or totally negative for the induction of the five catabolic enzymes (uronic isomerase, uxaC; altronate oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide: uxaB; mannonate hydrolyase, uxuA) and the transport system (exuT) of the hexuronate-inducible pathway, were isolated and analyzed enzymatically.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">Hexuronate-catabolizing revertants of the negative mutants showed a constitutive synthesis for some or all of these enzymes.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Negative and constitutive mutations were localized in the same genetic locus, called exuR, and the following order for the markers situated between the min 65 and 68 was determined: argG--exuR--exuT--uxaC--uxaA--tolC.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">The enzymatic characterization of the pleiotropic negative and constitutive mutants of the exuR gene suggests that the exuR regulatory gene product exerts a specific and total control on the three exuT, uszB, and uxaC-uxaA operons of the galacturonate pathway and a partial control on the uxuA-uxuB operon of the glucuronate pathway.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">The analysis of diploid strains conatining both the wild type and a negative or constitutive allele of the exuR gene, as well as the analysis of thermosensitive mutants of the exuR gene, was in agreement with a negative regulatory mechanism for the control of the hexuronate system.</sentence>
