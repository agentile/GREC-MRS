<sentence id="S1">Identification of a functional binding site for activin on the type I receptor ALK4.</sentence>

<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">Activins, like other members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) superfamily, initiate signaling by assembling a complex of two types of transmembrane serine/threonine receptor kinases classified as type II (ActRII or ActRIIB) and type I (ALK4).</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">A kinase-deleted version of ALK4 can form an inactive complex with activin and ActRII/IIB and thereby acts in a dominant negative manner to block activin signaling.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Using the complex structure of bone morphogenetic protein-2 bound to its type I receptor (ALK3) as a guide, we introduced extracellular domain mutations in the context of the truncated ALK4 (ALK4-trunc) construct and assessed <term sem="SPAN" id="T1" lex="the_ability_of_the_mutants">the ability of <term sem="Mutant_Gene" id="T2" lex="the_mutants">the mutants</term></term> to inhibit <term sem="Protein" id="T3" lex="activin">activin</term> function.</sentence>

<sentence id="S8">Together, these residues likely constitute the binding surface for activin on ALK4.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">Cross-linking studies measuring binding of 125I-activin-A to the ALK4-trunc mutants in the presence of ActRII implicated the same residues.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">Our results indicate that there is only a partial overlap of the binding sites on ALK4 and ALK3 for activin-A and bone morphogenetic protein-2, respectively.</sentence>
