<sentence id="S1">Maltose/maltodextrin system of Escherichia coli: transport, metabolism, and regulation.</sentence>
</ArticleTitle>
<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">The maltose system of Escherichia coli offers an unusually rich set of enzymes, transporters, and regulators as objects of study.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">This system is responsible for the uptake and metabolism of glucose polymers (maltodextrins), which must be a preferred class of nutrients for E. coli in both mammalian hosts and in the environment.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Because the metabolism of glucose polymers must be coordinated with both the anabolic and catabolic uses of glucose and glycogen, an intricate set of <term sem="SPAN" id="T1" lex="regulatory_mechanisms">regulatory mechanisms</term> controls the expression of <term sem="Gene" id="T2" lex="mal_genes">mal genes</term>, the activity of the maltose transporter, and the activities of the maltose/maltodextrin catabolic enzymes.</sentence>

<clue>Because the metabolism of glucose polymers must be coordinated with both the anabolic and catabolic uses of glucose and glycogen, an intricate set of regulatory mechanisms controls the <clueType>expression</clueType> of mal genes, the activity of the maltose transporter, and the activities of the maltose/maltodextrin catabolic enzymes.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S6">The ease of isolating many of the mal gene products has contributed greatly to the understanding of the structures and functions of several classes of proteins.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">Not only was the outer membrane maltoporin, LamB, or the phage lambda receptor, the first virus receptor to be isolated, but also its three-dimensional structure, together with extensive knowledge of functional sites for ligand binding as well as for phage lambda binding, has led to a relatively complete description of this sugar-specific aqueous channel.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">The periplasmic maltose binding protein (MBP) has been studied with respect to its role in both maltose transport and maltose taxis.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">Again, the combination of structural and functional information has led to a significant understanding of how this soluble receptor participates in signaling the presence of sugar to the chemosensory apparatus as well as how it participates in sugar transport.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">The maltose transporter belongs to the ATP binding cassette family, and although its structure is not yet known at atomic resolution, there is some insight into the structures of several functional sites, including those that are involved in interactions with MBP and recognition of substrates and ATP.</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">A particularly astonishing discovery is the direct participation of <term sem="SPAN" id="T3" lex="the_transporter">the transporter</term> in <term sem="SPAN" id="T4" lex="transcriptional">transcriptional</term> control of <term sem="Operon" id="T5" lex="the_mal_regulon">the mal regulon</term>.</sentence>
