Gene-product relationships of fhlA and fdv genes of Escherichia coli. 
Synthesis of formate dehydrogenase coupled to formate hydrogenlyase activity in Escherichia coli was found to require the product of the fhlA gene. Transcription of fdhF, the gene coding for the 80-kilodalton (kDa) selenopeptide of formate dehydrogenase, was not detected in an fhlA genetic background. Mutations in the fhlA gene also abolished production of the hydrogenase activity associated with formate hydrogenlyase activity. The fhlA gene resides next to the hydB gene at 59 min in the E. coli chromosome, and the two genes are transcribed in opposite directions. The fhlA gene codes for a 78-kDa protein. A neighboring gene, fdv, codes for an 82-kDa protein, and the physiological role of this gene product is unknown, although a role in H2 metabolism can be detected.
