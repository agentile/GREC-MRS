Selected phenotypes of ihf mutants of Escherichia coli. 
In attempts to identify subunit-specific phenotypes of ihf mutants we analyzed viability, thermoresistance and protein synthesis patterns in ihfA and ihfB mutants and their respective parental strains. Despite some detected differences in the two-dimensional protein patterns, no significant subunit-specific, physiological effects could be observed. Each mutant was less viable and less thermoresistant than the wild type strain. Moreover, in contrast to the wild type the mutants did not reduce global protein synthesis after prolonged culturing. Examination of expression of transcriptional fusions allowed us to demonstrate autoregulation of both genes by IHF. Additional IHF binding sites in the regulatory region of both ihf genes were footprinted.
