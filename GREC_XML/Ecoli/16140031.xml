<sentence id="S1">Effect of oxygen, and ArcA and FNR regulators on the expression of genes related to the electron transfer chain and the TCA cycle in Escherichia coli.</sentence>
</ArticleTitle>
<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">Microbial cells possess numerous sensing/regulator systems in order to respond rapidly to environmental changes.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">Escherichia coli has several elaborate sensing mechanisms for response to the availability of oxygen and the presence of other electron acceptors.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">A group of global regulators, which include the one component Fnr protein and the two-component Arc system, coordinate the adaptive responses.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">To quantitate the contribution of Arc and FNR-dependent regulation under microaerobic conditions, the gene expression pattern of the electron transfer chain genes and the TCA cycle genes in wild-type E. coli, an arcA mutant, an fnr mutant, and a double arcA, fnr mutant, in glucose limited cultures and different oxygen concentrations was studied in chemostat cultures at steady state using QRT-PCR.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">It was found that the TCA cycle genes, <term sem="Gene" id="T1" lex="icd">icd</term>, <term sem="Gene" id="T2" lex="gltA">gltA</term>, <term sem="Gene" id="T3" lex="sucC">sucC</term>, and <term sem="Gene" id="T4" lex="sdhC">sdhC</term> are repressed by <term sem="Gene" id="T5" lex="ArcA">ArcA</term> while Fnr has a minor or no effect on the expression of these genes under microaerobic conditions.</sentence>

<sentence id="S9">Since significantly higher NADH/NAD+ ratios were previously observed in cultures of the arcA mutant strain compared to the wild type it seems that the cytochrome o oxidase (the product of cyoABCDE) cannot efficiently support aerobic respiration when the cells are grown under microaerobic conditions.</sentence>
