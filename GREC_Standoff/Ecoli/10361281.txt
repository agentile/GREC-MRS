The role of the trehalose system in regulating the maltose regulon of Escherichia coli. 
The maltose regulon consists of 10 genes encoding an ABC transporter for maltose and maltodextrins as well as enzymes necessary for their degradation. MalK, the energy-transducing subunit of the transport system, acts phenotypically as a repressor of MalT, the transcriptional activator of the mal genes. Using MacConkey maltose indicator plates we isolated an insertion mutation that strongly reduced the repressing effect of overproduced MalK. The insertion had occurred in treR encoding the repressor of the trehalose system. The loss of TreR function led to derepression of treB encoding an enzymeIITre of the PTS for trehalose and of treC encoding TreC, the cytoplasmic trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase. Further analysis revealed that maltose can enter the cell by facilitated diffusion through enzymeIITre, thus causing induction of the maltose system. In addition, derepression of TreC by itself caused induction of the maltose system, and a mutant lacking TreC was reduced in the uninduced level of mal gene expression indicating synthesis of endogenous inducer by TreC. Extracts containing TreC transformed [14C]-maltose into another 14C-labelled compound (preliminarily identified as maltose 1-phosphate) that is likely to be an alternative inducer of the maltose system.
