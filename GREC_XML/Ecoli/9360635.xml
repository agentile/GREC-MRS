<sentence id="S13">This study shows that while the susceptibility of the lacZ gene to inactivation processes poses a fundamental problem, correct regulation of the expression of a reporter gene by the lacI repressor protein is feasible in mammalian cells when assayed at the single cell level.</sentence>
<sentence id="S14">Thus, the model can in principle be used for the detection of mutagenic events at the lacI locus.</sentence>
