<sentence id="S1">Identification of multiple cyclin subunits of human P-TEFb.</sentence>
</ArticleTitle>
<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">The transition from abortive into productive elongation is proposed to be controlled by a positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) through phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">Drosophila P-TEFb was identified recently as a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK9) paired with a cyclin subunit (cyclin T).</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">We demonstrate here the cloning of multiple cyclin subunits of human P-TEFb (T1 and T2).</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">Cyclin T2 has two forms (T2a and T2b) because of alternative splicing.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">Both <term sem="Protein" id="T1" lex="cyclin_T1"><term sem="SPAN" id="T2" lex="cyclin_T1_and_T2">cyclin T1 and T2</term></term> are <term sem="SPAN" id="T3" lex="ubiquitously">ubiquitously</term> expressed.</sentence>

<Theme idref="T2" />
<Manner idref="T3" />
<clue>Both cyclin T1 and T2 are ubiquitously <clueType>expressed</clueType>.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S8">Immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion experiments carried out on HeLa nuclear extract (HNE) indicated that cyclin T1 and T2 were associated with CDK9 in a mutually exclusive manner and that almost all CDK9 was associated with either cyclin T1 or T2.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">Recombinant CDK9/cyclin T1, CDK9/cyclin T2a, and CDK9/cyclin T2b produced in Sf9 cells possessed DRB-sensitive kinase activity and functioned in transcription elongation in vitro.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">Either cyclin T1 or T2 was required to activate CDK9, and the truncation of the carboxyl terminus of the cyclin reduced, but did not eliminate, P-TEFb activity.</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">Cotransfection experiments indicated that <term sem="SPAN" id="T4" lex="all_three_CDK9/cyclin_combinations">all three CDK9/cyclin combinations</term> <term sem="SPAN" id="T5" lex="dramatically">dramatically</term> activated <term sem="Promoter" id="T6" lex="the_CMV_promoter">the CMV promoter</term>.</sentence>
