Regulation of expression of the yiaKLMNOPQRS operon for carbohydrate utilization in Escherichia coli: involvement of the main transcriptional factors. 
The yiaKLMNOPQRS (yiaK-S) gene cluster of Escherichia coli is believed to be involved in the utilization of a hitherto unknown carbohydrate which generates the intermediate L-xylulose. Transcription of yiaK-S as a single message from the unique promoter found upstream of yiaK is proven in this study. The 5' end has been located at 60 bp upstream from the ATG. Expression of the yiaK-S operon is controlled in the wild-type strain by a repressor encoded by yiaJ. No inducer molecule of the yiaK-S operon has been identified among over 80 carbohydrate or derivative compounds tested, the system being expressed only in a mutant strain lacking the YiaJ repressor. The lacZ transcriptional fusions in the genetic background of the mutant strain revealed that yiaK-S is modulated by the integration host factor and by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (Crp) activator complex. A twofold increase in the induction was observed during anaerobic growth, which was independent of ArcA or Fnr. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the YiaJ repressor binds to a promoter fragment extending from -50 to +121. These studies also showed that the cAMP-Crp complex can bind to two different sites. The lacZ transcriptional fusions of different fragments of the promoter demonstrated that binding of cAMP-Crp to the Crp site 1, centered at -106, is essential for yiaK-S expression. The 5' end of the yiaJ gene was determined, and its promoter region was found to overlap with the divergent yiaK-S promoter. Expression of yiaJ is autogenously regulated and reduced by the binding of Crp-cAMP to the Crp site 1 of the yiaK-S promoter.
