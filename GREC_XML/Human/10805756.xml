<sentence id="S3">Sox9 is a high-mobility-group domain-containing transcription factor required for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage formation.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">We used a yeast two-hybrid method based on Son of Sevenless (SOS) recruitment to screen a chondrocyte cDNA library and found that the catalytic subunit of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA-Calpha) interacted specifically with SOX9.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Next we found that two consensus PKA phosphorylation sites within SOX9 could be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and that SOX9 could be phosphorylated by PKA-Calpha in vivo.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">In COS-7 cells cotransfected with PKA-Calpha and SOX9 expression plasmids, PKA enhanced the phosphorylation of wild-type SOX9 but did not affect phosphorylation of a SOX9 protein in which the two PKA phosphorylation sites <term sem="Amino_Acids" id="T4" lex="(S(64)_and_S(211)">(S(64) and S(211)</term>) were mutated.</sentence>

<clue>In COS-7 cells cotransfected with PKA-Calpha and SOX9 expression plasmids, PKA enhanced the phosphorylation of wild-type SOX9 but did not affect phosphorylation of a SOX9 protein in which the two PKA phosphorylation sites (S(64) and S(211)) were <clueType>mutated</clueType>.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S7">Using a phosphospecific antibody that specifically recognized SOX9 phosphorylated at serine 211, one of the two PKA phosphorylation sites, we demonstrated that addition of cAMP to chondrocytes strongly increased the phosphorylation of endogenous Sox9.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">In addition, immunohistochemistry of mouse embryo hind legs showed that Sox9 phosphorylated at serine 211 was principally localized in the prehypertrophic zone of the growth plate, corresponding to the major site of expression of the parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) receptor.</sentence>
