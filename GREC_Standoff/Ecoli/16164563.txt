Plasticity in amino acid sensing of the chimeric receptor Taz. 
Taz is a chimeric receptor consisting of the periplasmic, transmembrane and most of the HAMP linker domains of the Escherichia coli aspartate receptor (Tar(Ec)) and the cytoplasmic signalling domain of the E. coli osmosensor EnvZ. Aspartate is one of several attractant ligands normally sensed by Tar and it interacts with Taz to induce OmpR-dependent transcription from the ompC promoter--albeit with reduced sensitivity relative to the chemotactic response it evokes via Tar. By combining Taz with a reporter system that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the ompC promoter, we were able to examine the interaction of Taz with all 20 natural amino acids. Some amino acids (Leu, Met, Val and Ser) reduced GFP expression, which in the case of leucine is likely attributed to a direct effect on the receptor, rather than an indirect effect through the leucine responsive protein (Lrp). Surprisingly, amino acids like Met and Ser--which are also attractants for Tar--'inhibited' Taz. Moreover, Taz exhibits a higher sensitivity to Leu compared with Asp, which is the inverse of Tar. Our results show the exquisite sensitivity of chemotactic receptors. Small conformational changes induced by making the chimera may have changed the way it responds to different amino acids.
