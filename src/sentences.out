Complementation analysis of the wild-type and mutant ompR genes exhibiting different phenotypes of osmoregulation of the ompF and ompC genes of Escherichia coli.
Expression of the ompF and ompC genes, which encode the major outer membrane proteins, OmpF and OmpC, respectively, is affected in a reciprocal manner by the osmolarity of the growth medium.
This osmoregulation is mediated by the OmpR protein, a positive regulator of both genes, which is encoded by the ompR gene.
Structural and functional properties of this regulatory protein were studied through complementation analysis of the wild-type and five mutant ompR genes that exhibited differences in osmoregulation of the expression of the OmpF and OmpC proteins.
Complementation was carried out with combinations of a host strain and a plasmid, each of which carried either the wild-type or a mutant ompR gene.
For example, ompR1, a deletion mutation with an OmpF- OmpC- phenotype, was dominant to OmpF+ or OmpC+ phenotypes conferred by other ompR genes.
Positive complementation of two mutant ompR genes was also observed in other combinations, when the two mutations were distantly located from each other on the OmpR protein.
These results, together with other observations, support the view that the OmpR protein has a two-domain structure, each domain exhibiting a different role in the expression of the OmpF and OmpC proteins, and that this protein takes a multimeric structure as a functional unit.
The GcvA protein both activates and represses the gcv operon and negatively regulates its own transcription.
GcvA binds to three sites in the gcv control region and to one site in the gcvA control region; each of these binding sites contains the conserved 5 bp DNA sequence 5'-CTAAT-3'.
This report describes the role this DNA sequence plays in autoregulation and expression of gcvA.
Through single base-pair mutations, the importance of three of these five basepairs in the autoregulation of gcvA expression is shown.
Two of the gcvA control region mutations described cause a gcvA::lacZ fusion to be overexpressed at 9-24 times the wild-type level.
The increase in expression is due in part to a complete loss of autoregulation and in part to a GcvA-independent mechanism.
This high level of gcvA expression subsequently causes the loss of purine-mediated repression of a gcvT::lacZ fusion.
However, overexpression of gcvR re-established purine-mediated repression of the gcvT::lacZ fusion, supporting the model for gcv regulation that suggests the need for a relatively constant GcvA to GcvR ratio for appropriate regulation of gcv expression in response to glycine and purine availability.
Definition of nitrite and nitrate response elements at the anaerobically inducible Escherichia coli nirB promoter: interactions between FNR and NarL.
Transcription initiation at the Escherichia coli nirB promoter is induced by anaerobic growth and further increased by the presence of nitrite or nitrate in the growth medium.
Expression from this promoter is totally dependent on the transcription factor, FNR, which binds between positions -52 and -30 upstream of the transcription startsite.
Comparison of these, and sequence elements at other promoters regulated by NarL, suggests a consensus NarL-binding sequence.
Mutations in the putative NarL-binding site at the nirB promoter decrease FNR-dependent anaerobic induction, suggesting that NarL acts as a helper to FNR during transcription activation.
These mutations also suppress induction by nitrite: single mutations at symmetry-related positions have similar effects, whilst double mutations have more severe effects, probably because two NarL subunits bind to the inverted repeat.
Disruption of narL decreases nitrite induction of the nirB promoter whilst not suppressing induction by nitrate, suggesting that there may be a second nitrate-responsive factor.
Nitrate induction was, however, suppressed by double mutations at symmetry-related positions in the NarL-binding site, suggesting that this putative second factor may bind to sequences similar to those recognized by NarL.
Expression of fimA, the structural gene for type 1 fimbriae of Escherichia coli, is phase variable.
Normal expression of fimA was shown to require the integration host factor (IHF).
Mutations in either the himA-or the himD (hip) gene, which encode the alpha and beta subunits of IHF, respectively, prevented phase variation and locked expression of fimA in either the "on" or "off" phase.
In addition, both himA and himD lesions caused a sevenfold reduction in expression of a phi(fimA-lacZ) operon fusion in strains in which fimA was locked in the on phase.
Thus, IHF plays a dual role in controlling fimA expression: it is required both for inversion of the fimA control region and for efficient expression from the fimA promoter.
A mechanism by which IHF may exert control over fimA expression is discussed.
Use of gene fusions to study expression of cysB, the regulatory gene of the cysteine regulon.
Strains of escherichia coli were constructed in which the lacZ gene is fused to cysB, the positive regulator gene of the cysteine regulon.
The fusion strains were used to study the regulation of the cysB gene by assaying the fused lacZ gene product.
The introduction of a cysB allele, either on a plasmid or on an episome to the fusion strains, resulted in the decrease of beta-galactosidase activity.
This implies that the cysB gene expression is autoregulated by its own product.
Because the metabolism of glucose polymers must be coordinated with both the anabolic and catabolic uses of glucose and glycogen, an intricate set of regulatory mechanisms controls the expression of mal genes, the activity of the maltose transporter, and the activities of the maltose/maltodextrin catabolic enzymes.
A particularly astonishing discovery is the direct participation of the transporter in transcriptional control of the mal regulon.
The MalT protein activates transcription at all mal promoters.
A subset also requires the cyclic AMP receptor protein for transcription.
The MalT protein requires maltotriose and ATP as ligands for binding to a dodecanucleotide MalT box that appears in multiple copies upstream of all mal promoters.
Despite this wealth of knowledge, there are still basic issues that require clarification concerning the mechanism of MalT-mediated activation, repression by the transporter, biosynthesis and assembly of the outer membrane and inner membrane transporter proteins, and interrelationships between the mal enzymes and those of glucose and glycogen metabolism.
Factor for inversion stimulation (FIS), the Escherichia coli protein, is a positive regulator of the transcription of genes that encode stable RNA species, such as rRNA and tRNA.
Transcription of the rnpB gene encoding M1 RNA, the catalytic subunit of E. coli RNase P, rapidly declines under stringent conditions, as does that of other stable RNAs.
We tested whether FIS binds to these sites, and if so, how it affects rnpB transcription.
Interestingly, FIS bound not only to the upstream region of the promoter, but also to the region from +4 to +18.
FIS activated rnpB transcription in vitro, but the level of activation was much lower than that of the rrnB promoter for rRNA.
Regulation of the ompC gene of Escherichia coli.
ompC expression in Escherichia coli K-12 is known to be regulated by the ompB locus, comprising the ompR and envZ genes, and the OmpR protein is believed to act as a positive transcriptional factor.
We examined the transcriptional capability of the ompC gene in vitro and found that RNA polymerase could transcribe ompC without a requirement for other transcriptional factors.
Furthermore, transcripts from three tandem promoters in ompC were identified in vitro.
The levels of beta-galactosidase indicate that ompC expression in vivo is dependent on the function of at least one of the upstream promoters.
The function of OmpR appears to be the enhancement of a basal level of ompC expression.
Gene expression from multicopy T7 promoter vectors proceeds at single copy rates in the absence of T7 RNA polymerase.
(1) for the T7 RNA polymerase-driven overexpression of proteins in Escherichia coli.
Gene expression in the absence of T7 RNA polymerase was evaluated either directly using lacZ reporter systems or indirectly by observing the susceptibility of plasmid-bearing tester strains to inhibition by an aromatic amino acid analog.
The production of repressor proteins and of a Trp repressor-LacZ chimera was readily detected, at levels comparable to those of haploid trpR+ or tyrR+ E. coli strains.
Such T7 vector constructs thus have two especially useful properties: first, they provide a means for the high-level production of various proteins in E. coli; second, they offer a technically advantageous point of departure for structure-function studies of genes whose overexpression from multicopy plasmids would normally be cytotoxic.
A factor that positively regulates cell division by activating transcription of the major cluster of essential cell division genes of Escherichia coli.
It is not known how the cell regulates the cellular concentrations of these essential elements of the division system.
We describe here a factor that activates cell division by specifically increasing transcription from one of the two promoters that lie immediately upstream of the ftsQAZ gene cluster.
The trans-acting factor is the product of the sdiA gene, which was isolated on the basis of its ability to suppress the division inhibitory effect of the MinC/MinD division inhibitor.
In addition, the sdiA gene product suppressed the action of other chromosomally encoded division inhibitors, induced minicell formation in wild type cells, and restored division activity to an ftsZ temperature-sensitive mutant grown under nonpermissive conditions.
All of these properties were explained by the ability of the sdiA gene product specifically to increase transcription of the ftsQAZ gene cluster, resulting in an increase in cellular concentration of the FtsZ protein.
The sdiA gene product is the first factor thus far identified that specifically regulates expression of this key group of cell division genes.
The gene yjfQ encodes the repressor of the yjfR-X regulon (ula), which is involved in L-ascorbate metabolism in Escherichia coli.
Mutations in yjfQ allowed us to identify this gene as the regulator of the operon yjfS-X (ula operon), reported to be involved in L-ascorbate metabolism.
Inactivation of this gene renders constitutive the expression of the ula operon, indicating that YjfQ acts as a repressor.
We also demonstrate that this repressor regulates the nearby yjfR gene, which in this way constitutes a regulon with the ula operon.
Transcriptional regulation of the divergent paa catabolic operons for phenylacetic acid degradation in Escherichia coli.
The expression of the divergently transcribed paaZ and paaABCDEFGHIJK catabolic operons, which are responsible for phenylacetic acid (PA) degradation in Escherichia coli, is driven by the Pz and Pa promoters, respectively.
To study the transcriptional regulation of the inducible paa catabolic genes, genetic and biochemical approaches were used.
Gel retardation assays showing that the PaaX regulator binds specifically to the Pa and Pz promoters were complemented with in vivo experiments that indicated a PaaX-mediated repression effect on the expression of Pa-lacZ and Pz-lacZ reporter fusions.
The region within the Pa and Pz promoters that is protected by the PaaX repressor in DNase I footprinting assays contains a conserved 15-base pair imperfect palindromic sequence motif that was shown, through mutational analysis, to be indispensable for PaaX binding and repression.
PA-coenzyme A (PA-CoA), but not PA, specifically inhibited binding of PaaX to the target sequences, thus confirming the first intermediate of the pathway as the true inducer and PaaX as the only bacterial regulatory protein described so far that responds to an aryl-CoA compound.
Superimposed in the specific PaaX-mediated regulation is transcriptional activation by the cAMP receptor protein and the integration host factor protein.
Regulation of expression of the adhE gene, encoding ethanol oxidoreductase in Escherichia coli: transcription from a downstream promoter and regulation by fnr and RpoS.
The adhE gene of Escherichia coli, located at min 27 on the chromosome, encodes the bifunctional NAD-linked oxidoreductase responsible for the conversion of acetyl-coenzyme A to ethanol during fermentative growth.
The expression of adhE is dependent on both transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls and is about 10-fold higher during anaerobic than during aerobic growth.
Although both start sites are NarL repressible in the presence of nitrate, Fnr activates only the -188 start site and Fis is required for the transcription of only the -292 start site.
In addition, it was discovered that RpoS activates adhE transcription at both start sites.
Available evidence indicates that under those conditions, the upstream promoter region acts as a silencer of the downstream transcriptional start site.
Translation of the mRNA starting at -292, but not the one starting at -188, requires RNase III.
The results support the previously postulated ribosomal binding site (RBS) occlusion model, according to which RNase III cleavage is required to release the RBS from a stem-loop structure in the long transcript.
Alp suppression of Lon: dependence on the slpA gene.
The Alp protease activity is detected in cells after introduction of plasmids carrying the alpA gene, which encodes an open reading frame of 70 amino acids.
Insertions which abolish Alp activity interrupt this open reading frame.
We have used Tn10 and lambda placMu mutagenesis to identify a chromosomal locus, slpA, that is required for alpA+ suppression of delta lon.
This locus maps at 57 min, close to the chromosomal location of alpA.
The expression of beta-galactosidase from a lac transcriptional fusion to slpA is increased six- to eightfold when the alpA+ gene is present on a multicopy plasmid.
Therefore, AlpA acts as a transcriptional regulator of the slpA gene(s); activation of slpA transcription is necessary to suppress the phenotypes of a delta lon mutation.
In an accompanying paper (J.E. Kirby, J.E. Trempy, and S. Gottesman, J. Bacteriol. 176:2068-2081, 1994), we show that neither AlpA nor SlpA is a component of the protease itself but that they are part of a regulatory cascade which leads to expression of the Alp protease.
Identification and characterization of a two-component sensor-kinase and response-regulator system (DcuS-DcuR) controlling gene expression in response to C4-dicarboxylates in Escherichia coli.
The dcuB gene of Escherichia coli encodes an anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate transporter that is induced anaerobically by FNR, activated by the cyclic AMP receptor protein, and repressed in the presence of nitrate by NarL.
In addition, dcuB expression is strongly induced by C4-dicarboxylates, suggesting the presence of a novel C4-dicarboxylate-responsive regulator in E. coli.
This paper describes the isolation of a Tn10 mutant in which the 160-fold induction of dcuB expression by C4-dicarboxylates is absent.
The yjdHG genes (redesignated dcuSR) appear to constitute an operon encoding a two-component sensor-regulator system (DcuS-DcuR).
A plasmid carrying the dcuSR operon restored the C4-dicarboxylate inducibility of dcuB expression in the dcuS mutant to levels exceeding those of the dcuS+ strain by approximately 1.8-fold.
The dcuS mutation affected the expression of other genes with roles in C4-dicarboxylate transport or metabolism.
Expression of the fumarate reductase (frdABCD) operon and the aerobic C4-dicarboxylate transporter (dctA) gene were induced 22- and 4-fold, respectively, by the DcuS-DcuR system in the presence of C4-dicarboxylates.
Studies employing a dcuA dcuB dcuC triple mutant unable to transport C4-dicarboxylates anaerobically revealed that C4-dicarboxylate transport is not required for C4-dicarboxylate-responsive gene regulation.
The ArC/XylS family of prokaryotic positive transcriptional regulators includes more than 100 proteins and polypeptides derived from open reading frames translated from DNA sequences.
The conserved stretch contains all the elements required to bind DNA target sequences and to activate transcription from cognate promoters.
Most regulators belonging to the AraC/XylS family recognize multiple binding sites in the regulated promoters.
Footprinting assays have suggested that these regulators protect a stretch of up to 20 bp in the target promoters, and multiple alignments of binding sites for a number of regulators have shown that the proteins recognize short motifs within the protected region.
Nitrate repression of the Escherichia coli pfl operon is mediated by the dual sensors NarQ and NarX and the dual regulators NarL and NarP.
The pfl operon is expressed at high levels anaerobically.
Growth of Escherichia coli in the presence of nitrate or nitrite led to a 45% decrease in expression when cells were cultivated in rich medium.
Nitrate repression, however, was significantly enhanced (sevenfold) when the cells were cultured in minimal medium.
Regulation of pfl expression by nitrate was dependent on the NarL, NarP, NarQ, and NarX proteins but independent of FNR, ArcA, and integration host factor, which are additional regulators of pfl expression.
Strains unable to synthesize any one of the NarL, NarP, NarQ, or NarX proteins, but retaining the capacity to synthesize the remaining three, exhibited essentially normal nitrate regulation.
In contrast, narL narP and narX narQ double null mutants were devoid of nitrate regulation when cultured in rich medium but they retained some nitrate repression (1.3-fold) when grown in minimal medium.
By using lacZ fusions, it was possible to localize the DNA sequences required to mediate nitrate repression to the pfl promoter-regulatory region.
DNase I footprinting studies identified five potential binding sites for the wild-type NarL protein in the pfl promoter-regulatory region.
Integration host factor is a negative effector of in vivo and in vitro expression of ompC in Escherichia coli.
Integration host factor (IHF) of Escherichia coli is a DNA-binding protein involved in gene expression and other cellular functions in E. coli and some of its bacteriophages and plasmids.
IHF binds to ompC DNA and protects a region of 35 base pairs located upstream from the ompC promoters.
The addition of IHF to a purified in vitro transcription system inhibited transcription from two of the three ompC promoters.
IHF mutants show increased expression of OmpC.
In addition, the OmpC- phenotype of certain strains is completely suppressed by a mutation in IHF.
ArgR-independent induction and ArgR-dependent superinduction of the astCADBE operon in Escherichia coli.
For Escherichia coli, growth in the absence of ammonia is termed nitrogen limited and results in the induction of genes that assimilate other nitrogen sources, a response mediated by sigma(54) and nitrogen regulator I (NR(I), also called NtrC).
The astCADBE operon, which is required for growth with arginine as the sole nitrogen source, is moderately expressed during general nitrogen limitation and maximally expressed in the presence of arginine.
The operon is also induced in stationary phase.
We used an ast-lacZ fusion to show that arginine stimulates expression, that ArgR, the arginine repressor, enhances expression from both promoters but is not essential, and that transcription by the two forms of the RNA polymerase is competitive and mutually exclusive.
We demonstrated the binding of RNA polymerase holoenzymes, NR(I), and ArgR to the promoter region in vitro.
We also reconstituted transcription from both promoters with purified components, which confirmed the accessory role of ArgR for the sigma(54)-dependent promoter.
Thus, the ast operon exhibits nitrogen source-specific induction that is unique for an NR(I)-dependent gene.
The transcriptional regulation of the ast operon in E. coli differs from that in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, in which ArgR is required for ast operon expression.
Three adjacent binding sites for cAMP receptor protein are involved in the activation of the divergent malEp-malKp promoters.
The divergent malEFG and malK-lamB-malM operons in Escherichia coli are controlled by partially overlapping promoters, whose activity depends on the presence of two transcriptional activators, MalT and the cAMP receptor protein (CRP).
We report the characterization of the in vitro interactions of CRP with its four adjacent binding sites and the analysis of their function in vivo.
By using the DNase I footprinting technique, we showed that CRP binds with high affinity to the three malEp-proximal sites and with a low affinity to the fourth site.
CRP binding to these sites is not cooperative, even though they are adjacent and located on the same face of the DNA double helix.
Mutations in any of the three high-affinity binding sites reduced both malEp and malKp activity.
The participation of several adjacent bound CRP molecules in the activation of a promoter is an unprecedented observation and might involve molecular mechanisms quite different from those used in the other CRP-controlled promoters.
The design of a new mutation model for active genes: expression of the Escherichia coli lac operon in mammalian cells.
Induction of a mutation in the lacI gene will result in the loss of transcriptional repression of the lacZ gene in mutated cells.
Subsequent introduction of the lacI gene into IIB1 cells resulted in correct transcriptional repression of the lacZ gene that could be alleviated by IPTG, an allosteric inducer of lacI repression.
However, in time the extent of beta-galactosidase induction gradually declined suggesting that the prolonged repressed transcriptional state triggers epigenetic inactivation.
Variegated expression of the lacZ gene was not confined to cultured cells since several transgenic lines also did not express the lacZ transgene.
Targeting of the lacZ gene to an endogenous housekeeping gene might prevent epigenetic inactivation.
Dual regulation of inaA by the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) and superoxide (soxRS) stress response systems of Escherichia coli.
The roles of the marRAB (multiple antibiotic resistance) operon and soxRS (superoxide response) genes in the regulation of inaA, an unlinked weak-acid-inducible gene, were studied.
inaA expression was estimated from the beta-galactosidase activity of a chromosomal inaA1::lacZ transcriptional fusion.
marR mutations that elevate marRAB transcription and engender multiple antibiotic resistance elevated inaA expression by 10- to 20-fold over that of the wild-type.
Overexpression of marA alone on a multicopy plasmid caused high constitutive expression of inaA in a strain with an extensive (39-kbp) marRAB deletion.
Salicylate, an inducer of marRAB and of an unidentified mar-independent antibiotic resistance system, induced inaA by 6-fold.
Two soxRS constitutive mutants that were tested showed elevated levels of inaA.
Paraquat, an inducer of the soxRS system, elevated inaA expression by 6- to 9-fold.
This induction was soxRS dependent and not mar dependent, whereas induction of inaA by salicylate was not dependent on soxRS.
Thus, induction of multiple antibiotic resistance and inaA by salicylate occurs via mar and an unidentified pathway, while induction by paraquat occurs via soxRS.
The yeiL open reading frame located at 48.5 min (2254 kb) in the nfo-fruA region of the Escherichia coli chromosome was predicted to encode a CRP and FNR paralogue capable of forming inter- or intra-molecular disulphide bonds and incorporating one iron-sulphur centre per 25 kDa subunit.
By analogy with FNR and FLP (the FNR-like protein of Lactobacillus casei) it was suggested that the transcription-regulatory activity of YeiL might be modulated by a sensory iron-sulphur cluster and/or by reversible disulphide bond formation.
A yeiL-lacZ transcriptional fusion showed that aerobic yeiL expression increases at least sixfold during stationary phase, requires RpoS, and is positively autoregulated by YeiL, positively activated by Lrp (and IHF in the absence of FNR) and negatively regulated by FNR.
A regulatory link between the synthesis of YeiK (a potential nucleoside hydrolase) and YeiL was inferred by showing that the yeiK and yeiL genes are divergently transcribed from overlapping promoters.
A 12-cistron Escherichia coli operon (hyf) encoding a putative proton-translocating formate hydrogenlyase system.
The hyf operon is located at 55.8-56.0 min and encodes a putative nine-subunit hydrogenase complex (hydrogenase four or Hyf), a potential formate- and sigma 54-dependent transcriptional activator, HyfR (related to FhlA), and a possible formate transporter, FocB (related to FocA).
Previously, it was shown that OxyR is required for repression of the Ag43-encoding gene, agn43, and that Dam-dependent methylation of three GATC target sequences in the regulatory region abrogates OxyR binding.
Here we report further characterization of agn43 transcription and its regulation.
Transcription was initiated from a sigma(70)-dependent promoter at the G residue of the upstream GATC sequence.
Template DNA and RNA polymerase were sufficient to obtain transcription in vitro, but DNA methylation enhanced the level of transcription.
Analyses of transcription in vivo of agn'-lacZ with mutated Dam target sequences support this conclusion.
Since methylation also abrogates OxyR binding, this indicates that methylation plays a dual role in facilitating agn43 transcription.
In vitro transcription from an unmethylated template was repressed by OxyR(C199S), which resembles the reduced form of OxyR.
Deletion analyses of the regulatory region showed that a 101-nucleotide region of the agn43 regulatory region containing the promoter and this OxyR binding region was sufficient for Dam- and OxyR-dependent phase variation.
Regulated expression in vitro of genes coding for formate hydrogenlyase components of Escherichia coli.
Purified FHLA, the transcriptional activator of the formate regulon from Escherichia coli, is able to efficiently stimulate transcription from the sigma 54-dependent promoters of the fdhF, hyp, and hyc transcriptional units.
Expression was dependent on the presence of sigma 54, of the upstream activatory sequence (UAS), and of formate.
The integration host factor (IHF) had a direct effect on the expression (in vivo and in vitro) of the hyp and hyc genes but not of the fdhF gene.
Binding of IHF within the region between the hyp and the hyc operon could be shown.
A model is proposed for the transcriptional regulation of the inversely oriented hyp and hyc operons.
It involves two upstream regulatory sequences, one between the hyp and the hyc operon (IR1), and the other between hycA and hycB (IR2).
The UAS situated within IR1 is responsible for activation of the hyc operon, that within IR2 for activation of the hyp operon.
A supramolecular transcription complex is proposed which involves the binding of IHF to a site located between the UAS and the promoter responsible for transcription of the hyc operon.
The fadL gene of Escherichia coli codes for an outer membrane protein that is involved in the uptake of long-chain fatty acids.
Furthermore, in vitro transcription of the fadL gene was strongly repressed by the addition of OmpR and EnvZ proteins.
The results of gel retardation and DNase I protection experiments indicated that OmpR, after incubation with the protein kinase EnvZ, specifically binds to at least four sites around the fadL promoter, two upstream and two downstream from the transcriptional start site.
These results suggest that transcription of the fadL gene is osmotically regulated by the OmpR-EnvZ two-component system.
CAP and Nag repressor binding to the regulatory regions of the nagE-B and manX genes of Escherichia coli.
A repressor protein for the regulon is encoded by the gene nagC, one of the genes of the nagBACD operon.
Strains overproducing the NagC protein have been used to investigate the binding of repressor to the intergenic nagE-B regulatory region.
Two binding sites have been detected, overlapping the promoters of the nagE and nagB genes.
NagC binding produces a series of DNase I hypersensitive sites separated by 9 to 11 bp in the region between the two NagC binding sites, supporting a model where the NagC proteins bind co-operatively to these two sites on the DNA and interact to form a DNA loop.
A strong CAP binding site exists between the two operator sites.
CAP and NagC can bind simultaneously and produce a complex more stable than the binary NagC-DNA complex.
Transcriptional organization and regulation of the Escherichia coli K30 group 1 capsule biosynthesis (cps) gene cluster.
Escherichia coli group 1 capsules are important virulence determinants, yet little is known about the transcriptional organization or regulation of their biosynthetic (cps) operons.
Transcription of the prototype serotype K30 cluster is modulated by the JUMPStart-RfaH antitermination mechanism, with the cps promoter being localized to a region immediately upstream of the JUMPStart sequence.
A putative stem-loop structure located within the K30 cps cluster separates conserved genes with products that are required for surface expression of capsule from serotype-specific genes encoding enzymes for polymer repeat-unit synthesis and polymerization.
This putative stem-loop structure significantly reduces transcription in a termination-probe vector and may contribute to differential expression of the cps genes.
However, neither overexpression of the transcriptional activator RcsB nor an rcsB::aadA chromosomal insertion altered the level of transcription measured by cps::lacZ fusions.
In the group 1 strains examined, an RcsAB box was found immediately upstream of galF, a gene involved in the production of sugar nucleotide precursors.
Overexpression of RcsB was found to result in a threefold increase in transcription of a galF::lacZ chromosomal fusion.
Moreover, overexpression of GalF gave rise to a two- to threefold increase in cell-free as well as cell-associated capsule, without affecting cps::lacZ activity.
These results indicate that transcription of the E. coli group 1 capsule cluster itself is not regulated by the Rcs system and may, in fact, be constitutive.
However, the Rcs system can potentially influence levels of capsular polysaccharide production by increasing galF transcription and influencing the available pool of biosynthetic precursors.
Anomalous DnaA protein binding to the regulatory region of the Escherichia coli aldA gene.
A binding site for DnaA protein was identified in the regulatory region of the aldA gene of Escherichia coli.
Specific binding was demonstrated by in vitro assays including filter binding as well as mobility shift in a polyacrylamide gel of the DnaA-DNA complex.
In cells growing in minimal medium containing glucose, expression of ss-galactosidase activity from an aldA-lacZ fusion gene was suppressed by oversupply of DnaA protein and was enhanced by reducing the free DnaA level.
These results suggest that DnaA protein negatively regulates expression of the aldA gene under these conditions.
Transcription activation at the Escherichia coli melAB promoter: the role of MelR and the cyclic AMP receptor protein.
Using purified Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and a cloned DNA fragment carrying the entire melibiose operon intergenic region, we have demonstrated in vitro open complex formation and activation of transcription initiation at the melAB promoter.
This activation is dependent on MelR and melibiose.
These studies also show that the cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) interacts with the melAB promoter and increases MelR-dependent transcription activation.
We showed previously that MelR binds to two identical 18 bp target sequences centred at position -100.5 (Site 1) and position -62.5 (Site 2).
In this work, we show that MelR additionally binds to two other related 18 bp sequences: Site 1', centred at position -120.5, located immediately upstream of Site 1, and Site R, at position -238.5, which overlaps the transcription start site of the divergent melR promoter.
MelR can bind to Site 1', Site 1, Site 2 and Site R, in both the absence and the presence of melibiose.
However, in the presence of melibiose, MelR also binds to a fifth site (Site 2', centred at position -42.5) located immediately downstream of Site 2, and overlapping the -35 region of the melAB promoter.
Additionally, although CRP is unable to bind to the melAB promoter in the absence of MelR, in the presence of MelR, it binds to a site located between MelR binding Site 1 and Site 2.
We propose that expression from the melAB promoter has an absolute requirement for MelR binding to Site 2'.
Optimal expression of the melAB promoter requires Sites 1', Site 1, Site 2 and Site 2'; CRP acts as a 'bridge' between MelR bound at Sites 1' and 1 and at Sites 2 and 2', increasing expression from the melAB promoter.
In a genetic screening directed to identify genes involved in biofilm formation, mutations in the cpxA gene were found to reduce biofilm formation by affecting microbial adherence to solid surfaces.
We show that the negative effect of the cpxA mutation on biofilm formation results from a decreased transcription of the curlin encoding csgA gene.
The cpxA101 mutation abolishes cpxA phosphatase activity and results in the accumulation of phosphorylated CpxR.
Features of the strain carrying the cpxA101 mutation are a reduced ability to form biofilm and low levels of csgA transcription.
Our results indicate that the cpxA gene increases the levels of csgA transcription by dephosphorylation of CpxR, which acts as a negative regulator at csgA.
Cross-induction of glc and ace operons of Escherichia coli attributable to pathway intersection.
Characterization of the glc promoter.
The metabolic pathways specified by the glc and ace operons in Escherichia coli yield glyoxylate as a common intermediate, which is acted on by two malate synthase isoenzymes: one encoded by glcB and the other by aceB.
Null mutations in either gene exhibit no phenotype, because of cross-induction of the ace operon by glycolate and the glc operon by acetate.
In this study, the regulation of the glc operon, comprising the structural genes glcDEFGB, was analyzed at the molecular level.
This operon, activated by growth on glycolate, is transcribed as a single message and is under the positive control of GlcC encoded by a divergent gene.
Expression of the glc operon is strongly dependent on the integration host factor (IHF) and is repressed by the global respiratory regulator ArcA-P.
In vitro gel-shift experiments demonstrated direct binding of the promoter DNA to IHF and ArcA-P.
Mutant analysis indicated that cross-induction of the glc operon by acetate is mediated by the GlcC protein that recognizes the compound as an alternative effector.
The similar pattern of regulation of the Glc and Ace systems by IHF and ArcA-P ensures their effective cross-induction.
Control of transcription of gal repressor and isorepressor genes in Escherichia coli.
Two regulatory proteins, Gal repressor and isorepressor, control the expression of the gal and mgl operons in Escherichia coli.
Study of the promoter-lacZ gene fusions introduced into the chromosome indicated that galS expression was elevated in cells in which the normal galS gene was interrupted, but not in cells in which the galR gene was deleted.
When both genes were disrupted, galS expression was further elevated.
Expression from the galS promoter was stimulated by the addition of D-fucose, repressed by glucose, and dependent on cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP).
Expression of a similar gene fusion of the galR promoter to lacZ was unregulated.
The increased concentration of the isorepressor when inducer is present may facilitate early shutoff of the isorepressor-regulated genes of the gal regulon when inducer (substrate) concentration falls.
PhoB-dependent transcriptional activation of the iciA gene during starvation for phosphate in Escherichia coli.
In order to investigate the in vivo function of this protein, expression of the iciA gene was studied by monitoring the beta-galactosidase activity specified by an iciA promoter-lacZ fusion inserted into the chromosome.
Among the conditions tested (carbon starvation, the stringent response, phosphate starvation, and the SOS response), only phosphate depletion increased iciA expression.
Enhanced expression of iciA-lacZ was dependent upon the PhoB protein.
PhoB is known to be a transcriptional activator of the Pho regulon, expression of which is activated during phosphate starvation.
It was also found that the iciA promoter contains a PhoB protein-binding sequence, termed the Pho box, which is necessary for the activation of genes of the Pho regulon.
We found previously that FNR binds to a site centred at position - 41.5 at the nir promoter, but that FNR-dependent activation is repressed by IHF binding to a site centred at position -88 (IHF I) and Fis binding to sites centred at positions -142 (Fis I) and +23 (Fis II).
Our results show that the nir promoter contains a second IHF site at position -115 (IHF II) and a third Fis site at position -97 (Fis III), and that IHF, Fis and FNR can bind together to form multiprotein complexes.
Surprisingly, IHF binding at the IHF II site increases FNR-dependent activation by decreasing the repression mediated by IHF and Fis binding at the other sites.
In previous work, we found that NarL or NarP activates the nir promoter by binding to a site centred at position -69.5 and counteracting the repressive effects of IHF and Fis.
We now show that NarL can displace IHF bound at the IHF I site, but IHF is unable to displace bound NarL.
We suggest that NarL interferes with IHF binding at the nir promoter by distorting the minor groove at its target site, and we argue that the resulting activation by NarL results from remodelling of the local nucleoprotein structure to facilitate FNR-dependent transcription.
The Escherichia coli arginine repressor (ArgR) controls expression of the arginine biosynthetic genes and acts as an accessory protein in Xer site-specific recombination at cer and related plasmid recombination sites.
In this work, ArgR mutants that are defective in trimer-trimer interactions and bind DNA as trimers in an L-arginine-independent manner are isolated and characterized.
Trimeric ArgR is impaired in its ability to repress the arginine biosynthetic genes and in Xer site-specific recombination.
A transducing lambda phage carrying glpD''lacZ, glpR, and malT was isolated from a strain harboring a glpD''lacZ fusion.
Comparison of restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns of DNA isolated from this phage with that of the previously cloned malT region (Raibaud and Schwartz 1980) facilitated the construction of recombinant plasmids carrying different portions of the glpD-malT region.
Results of minicell analysis and complementation studies showed that this region of the chromosome encodes at least five polypeptides.
Hybrid plasmids carrying glpD''lacZ and glpR''lacZ fusions were constructed.
Restriction endonuclease cleavage analysis of these two plasmids demonstrated that glpD and glpR are divergently transcribed.
The OmpR protein of Escherichia coli binds to sites in the ompF promoter region in a hierarchical manner determined by its degree of phosphorylation.
In Escherichia coli the ompF gene encodes a major outer membrane porin protein that is differentially regulated by the OmpR protein.
OmpR acts as a positive as well as a negative regulator of ompF expression by binding to DNA sequences in the ompF promoter region.
The DNA binding activity of OmpR is itself regulated by phosphorylation through the kinase protein EnvZ.
By using purified OmpR and various regions of the ompF promoter we show that phosphorylation causes binding of OmpR to a DNA region between the -40 to -100 region of the ompF promoter previously shown to be important for ompF expression.
This latter site has been reported to be important for ompF repression.
We also provide evidence that OmpR binding at the -360 to -380 region requires previous binding at downstream sequences, which is indicative of long range interactions between OmpR molecules.
We interpret our results in terms of a model for ompF regulation involving hierarchical binding by phosphorylated OmpR and potential DNA looping.
Transcription of rpoH, encoding the Escherichia coli heat-shock regulator sigma32, is negatively controlled by the cAMP-CRP/CytR nucleoprotein complex.
In Escherichia coli, the rpoH gene encoding the essential heat-shock regulator sigma32, is expressed in a complex manner.
Transcription occurs from four promoters (P1, P3, P4 and P5) and is modulated by several factors including (i) two sigma factors (sigma70 and sigmaE); (ii) the global regulator CRP; and (iii) the DnaA protein.
Here, a further dissection of the rpoH regulatory region has revealed that an additional transcription control exists that appears to link rpoH expression to nucleoside metabolism.
The cAMP-CRP complex and the CytR anti-activator bind co-operatively to the promoter region forming a repression complex that overlaps the sigmaE-dependent P3 promoter and the sigma70-dependent P4 and P5 promoters.
During steady-state growth conditions with glycerol as the carbon and energy source, transcription from P3, P4 and P5 is reduced approximately threefold by CytR, whereas transcription from the upstream promoter, P1, appears to be unaffected.
Furthermore, in strains that slightly overproduce CytR, transcription from P3, P4 and P5 is reduced even further (approximately 10-fold), and repression can be fully neutralized by the addition of the inducer cytidine to the growth medium.
In the induced state, P4 is the strongest promoter and, together with P3 and P5, it is responsible for most rpoH transcription (65-70%).
At present, CytR has been shown to 'fine tune' transcription of two genes (rpoH and ppiA) that are connected with protein-folding activities.
The global regulator CsrA (carbon storage regulator) is an RNA binding protein that coordinates central carbon metabolism, activates flagellum biosynthesis and motility, and represses biofilm formation in Escherichia coli.
CsrA activity is antagonized by the untranslated RNA CsrB, to which it binds and forms a globular ribonucleoprotein complex.
CsrA indirectly activates csrB transcription, in an apparent autoregulatory mechanism.
Mutations affecting the BarA/UvrY two-component signal transduction system decreased csrB transcription but did not affect csrA'-'lacZ expression.
Both csrA and uvrY were required for optimal barA expression.
Ectopic expression of uvrY suppressed the csrB-lacZ expression defects caused by uvrY, csrA, or barA mutations; csrA suppressed csrA or barA defects; and barA complemented only the barA mutation.
Purified UvrY protein stimulated csrB-lacZ expression approximately sixfold in S-30 transcription-translation reactions, revealing a direct effect of UvrY on csrB transcription.
Disruption of sdiA, which encodes a LuxR homologue, decreased the expression of uvrY'-'lacZ and csrB-lacZ fusions but did not affect csrA'-'lacZ.
Ectopic expression of uvrY stimulated biofilm formation by a csrB-null mutant, indicative of a CsrB-independent role for UvrY in biofilm development.
Collectively, these results demonstrate that uvrY resides downstream from csrA in a signaling pathway for csrB and that CsrA stimulates UvrY-dependent activation of csrB expression by BarA-dependent and -independent mechanisms.
The promoter P(cer), located centrally within cer, is also required for stable plasmid maintenance.
P(cer) is active in plasmid multimers and directs transcription of a short RNA, Rcd, which appears to inhibit cell division.
This study has shown that ArgR does not act as a transcriptional repressor of P(cer) in plasmid monomers.
P(cer) is unusual in that the -35 and -10 hexamers are separated by only 15 bp and this study has demonstrated that increasing this to a more conventional spacing results in elevated activity.
An increase to 17 bp resulted in a 10- to 20-fold increase in activity, while smaller effects were seen when the spacer was increased to 16 bp or 18 bp.
These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that P(cer) activation involves realignment of the -35 and -10 sequences within a recombinational synaptic complex.
This predicts that a 17 bp spacer promoter derivative should be down-regulated by plasmid multimerization, and this is confirmed experimentally.
Molecular analysis by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis of the cis-acting upstream sequence involved in activation of the ompF promoter in Escherichia coli.
Expression of the ompF gene coding for an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli is regulated by a transcriptional activation mechanism that requires the ompR gene product that acts on nucleotides located upstream of the -35 and -10 regions of the ompF promoter.
The nucleotides extending from position -91 to -79 are essential not only for sequence-specific recognition of the ompF promoter by the OmpR protein, but also for OmpR-dependent activation of the ompF promoter.
It was also demonstrated that the nucleotides extending from position -111 to -92 play a role in stimulation of the ompF expression.
Based on the results, the structure and function of the upstream sequence of the ompF promoter are discussed in relation to activation of the ompF promoter by the OmpR protein.
Transcriptional regulation in response to oxygen and nitrate of the operons encoding the [NiFe] hydrogenases 1 and 2 of Escherichia coli.
Synthesis of the [NiFe] hydrogenases 1 and 2 of Escherichia coli is induced in response to anaerobiosis and is repressed when nitrate is present in the growth medium.
The hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2 enzymes are encoded by the polycistronic hyaABCDEF and hybOABCDEFG operons, respectively.
Primer extension analysis was used to determine the initiation site of transcription of both operons.
This permitted the construction of single-copy lacZ operon fusions, which were used to examine the transcriptional regulation of the two operons.
Expression of both was induced by anaerobiosis and repressed by nitrate, which is in complete accord with earlier biochemical studies.
Anaerobic induction of the hyb operon was only partially dependent on the FNR protein and, surprisingly, was enhanced by an arcA mutation.
This latter result indicated that ArcA suppresses anaerobic hyb expression and that a further factor, which remains to be identified, is involved in controlling anaerobic induction of operon expression.
Nitrate repression of hyb expression was mediated by the NarL/NarX and NarP/NarQ two-component regulatory systems.
Remarkably, a narP mutant lacked anaerobic induction of hyb expression, even in the absence of added nitrate.
Anaerobic induction of hya expression was dependent on the ArcA and AppY regulators, which confirms earlier observations by other authors.
Nitrate repression of the hya operon was mediated by both NarL and NarP.
Taken together, these data indicate that although the hya and hyb operons share common regulators, there are important differences in the control of expression of the individual operons.
Contributions of UP elements and the transcription factor FIS to expression from the seven rrn P1 promoters in Escherichia coli.
The high activity of the rrnB P1 promoter in Escherichia coli results from a cis-acting DNA sequence, the UP element, and a trans-acting transcription factor, FIS.
In this study, we examine the effects of FIS and the UP element at the other six rrn P1 promoters.
Similarly, FIS binds upstream of, and activates, all seven rrn P1 promoters but to different extents.
Surprisingly, the FIS sites upstream of site I play a much larger role in transcription from most rrn P1 promoters compared to rrnB P1.
These studies have implications for the control of gene expression of unlinked multigene families.
The CRP-cAMP complex and downregulation of the glnAp2 promoter provides a novel regulatory linkage between carbon metabolism and nitrogen assimilation in Escherichia coli.
In Escherichia coli, glnA (encoding glutamine synthetase) is transcribed from two promoters (glnAp1 and glnAp2).
The glnAp1 is a sigma(70)-dependent promoter that is activated by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP).
Under nitrogen-deficient growth conditions, glnAp1 is repressed by NtrC-phosphate.
The downstream glnAp2 promoter is sigma(54)-dependent and is activated by NtrC-phosphate.
Here, we show that glnAp2 expression is affected by different carbon sources and that the CRP-cAMP complex inhibits the glnAp2 promoter activity.
When glnAp2 is activated by NifA, a similar inhibitory effect by CRP-cAMP is observed.
CRP-cAMP inhibits sigma(54)-dependent glnAp2 strongly, by 21-fold.
By activating glnAp1 and downregulating glnAp2, the overall effect of CRP-cAMP on glnA expression is an approximately fourfold reduction, which correlates with the reduction of gamma-glutamyl transferase activities in the cells.
We propose therefore that a physiological role of CRP-cAMP activation of glnAp1 is to partially compensate for CRP-cAMP downregulation of glnAp2, allowing a low but non-negligible level of expression of the important genes transcribed from it.
It is now well established that the sigmaE regulon of Escherichia coli is induced by misfolding of proteins in the periplasm and the outer membrane.
htrA belongs to this regulon and encodes a periplasmic protease involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins.
Closer examination of the putative signal transduction pathway modulating htrA transcription has led us to the identification of two new genes.
Biochemical and genetic evidence shows that these two genes encode two phosphoprotein phosphatases, designated PrpA and PrpB.
Crl, a low temperature-induced protein in Escherichia coli that binds directly to the stationary phase sigma subunit of RNA polymerase.
The alternative sigma factor sigma(S) (RpoS) of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase regulates the expression of stationary phase and stress-response genes.
sigma(S) is also required for the transcription of the cryptic genes csgBA that encode the subunits of the curli proteins.
The expression of the csgBA genes is regulated in response to a multitude of physiological signals.
In stationary phase, these genes are transcribed by the sigma(S) factor, and expression of the operon is enhanced by the small protein Crl.
It has been shown that Crl stimulates the activity of sigma(S), leading to an increased transcription rate of a subset of genes of the rpoS regulon in stationary phase.
We show here that Crl interacts directly with sigma(S) and that this interaction promotes binding of the sigma(S) holoenzyme (Esigma(S)) to the csgBA promoter.
Expression of Crl is increased during the transition from growing to stationary phase.
We therefore propose that Crl is a second thermosensor, besides DsrA, controlling sigma(S) activity.
EnvZ functions through OmpR to control porin gene expression in Escherichia coli K-12.
The regulatory proteins OmpR and EnvZ are both required to activate expression of the genes for the major outer membrane porin proteins, OmpF and OmpC, of Escherichia coli K-12.
Here we show that OmpR, under certain conditions, could activate porin expression in the complete absence of EnvZ.
In addition, the pleiotropic phenotypes conferred by a particular envZ mutation (envZ473) required the presence of functional OmpR protein.
These results lead us to conclude that EnvZ and OmpR act in sequential fashion to activate porin gene expression; i.e., EnvZ modifies or in some way directs OmpR, which in turn acts at the appropriate porin gene promoter.
Expression of the genes coding for the Escherichia coli integration host factor are controlled by growth phase, rpoS, ppGpp and by autoregulation.
Transcriptional control of the himA and the himD/hip genes coding for the two subunits of the integration host factor (IHF) was investigated.
Expression from both promoters was found to increase as the cells enter stationary phase.
Mutation in rpoS, known to be induced upon entry to stationary phase, dramatically reduced the growth-phase response of the himA P4 promoter but had only a small effect on the induction of the himD/hip promoter.
The increased activity of both promoters required the presence of the relA and spoT genes, suggesting that ppGpp plays a major role in the response to stationary phase.
An artificial increase in ppGpp in exponentially growing cells induced a rapid increase in himA P4 and himD/hip mRNA levels.
Therefore, it seems that different mechanisms involving RpoS and ppGpp regulate the growth-phase response of the two promoters.
We propose that the effect of ppGpp on himA P4 is mediated via RpoS whereas the himD/hip promoter is affected by ppGpp independently of RpoS.
Expression of the himD/hip and himA genes was found to be subject to negative autoregulation.
IHF-binding sites, implicated in autoregulation, were found to overlap both the himD/hip and himA P4 promoters.
An additional IHF-binding site was found upstream of the himD/hip promoter.
Upon return to permissive temperature (30 degrees C), the transcripts reappeared coordinately about 15 min after the first synchronized initiation and then declined sharply again 10 min later, just before the second initiation.
Although these observations were consistent with the idea that mioC transcription might have to be terminated prior to initiation, it was found that the interval between initiations at permissive temperature, i.e., the eclipse period, was not influenced by the time required to shut down mioC transcription, since the eclipse was the same for chromosomes and minichromosomes which lacked mioC transcription.
This finding did not, in itself, rule out the possibility that mioC transcription must be terminated prior to initiation of replication, since it might normally be shut off before initiation, and never be limiting, even during the eclipse.
Therefore, experiments were performed to determine whether the continued presence of mioC transcription during the process of initiation altered the timing of initiation.
It was found that minichromosomes possessing a deletion in the DnaA box upstream of the promoter transcribed mioC continuously and replicated with the same timing as those that either shut down expression prior to initiation or lacked expression entirely.
Thus, transcription through oriC emanating from the mioC gene promoter is normally inhibited prior to initiation of replication by the binding of DnaA protein, but replication can initiate with the proper timing even when transcription is not shut down; i.e., mioC does not serve as a negative regulator of initiation.
On this basis, the eclipse constitutes the time for methylation of the newly formed DNA strands (15 to 20 min at 30 degrees C) followed by the time for DnaA protein to bind and activate oriC for replication (10 min).
Transcriptional control mediated by the ArcA two-component response regulator protein of Escherichia coli: characterization of DNA binding at target promoters.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I protection assays indicate that where the phosphorylated form of the ArcA protein (ArcA-P) is expected to act as a transcriptional repressor (e.g., of lctPRD and gltA-sdhCDAB), the effect is likely to be mediated by sequestration of cis-controlling transcriptional regulatory elements.
In contrast, in the case of cydAB, for which ArcA-P is expected to function as a transcriptional activator, two discrete binding sites have been identified upstream of a known promoter, and activation from these sites is likely to be mediated by a mechanism typical of the type I class of prokaryotic transcriptional activators.
These sequences are recognized by at least three regulators, Gal repressor (GalR), Gal isorepressor (GalS) and cAMP receptor protein (CRP), which modulate transcription from these promoters.
The negative regulators, GalR and GalS, discriminate between utilization of the high-affinity (regulated by GalS) and low-affinity (regulated by GalR) transport systems, and modulate the expression of genes for galactose metabolism in an overlapping fashion.
GalS is itself autogenously regulated and CRP dependent, while the gene for GalR is constitutive.
The gal operon encoding the enzymes for galactose metabolism has two promoters regulated by CRP in opposite ways; one (P1) is stimulated and the other (P2) inhibited by CRP.
Both promoters are strongly repressed by GalR but weakly by GalS.
Characterization of the gntT gene encoding a high-affinity gluconate permease in Escherichia coli.
We characterized the gntT gene encoding a high-affinity gluconate permease of Escherichia coli K-12.
Primer extension and lacZ-operon fusion analyses revealed that gntT has one strong and two weak promoters, all of which are regulated positively by cAMP-CRP and negatively by GntR.
Gluconate-specific uptake activity was observed with cells harboring the gntT plasmid clone, which was enhanced by the presence of gntK encoding gluconate kinase.
Regulation of the ndh gene of Escherichia coli by integration host factor and a novel regulator, Arr.
The ndh gene of Escherichia coli encodes the non-proton-translocating NADH dehydrogenase II.
Expression of the ndh gene is subject to a complex network of regulatory controls at the transcriptional level.
Under anaerobic conditions ndh is repressed by the regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction (FNR).
However, in the absence of FNR, ndh expression is activated by the amino acid response regulator (Arr) during anaerobic growth in rich medium.
Expression of the ndh gene varies during the growth cycle in response to the intracellular concentration of the heat-stable DNA-binding protein, Fis.
In this work two additional heat-stable proteins, integration host factor (IHF) and the histone-like protein HU were found to interact with the ndh promoter.
IHF was shown to bind at three sites centred at +26, -17 and -58 in the ndh promoter (Kd = 10(-8) M), to prevent open-complex formation and to repress ndh transcription in vitro.
Studies with an ndh-lacZ fusion confirmed that IHF represses ndh expression in vivo.
Studies with the FNR-activated and amino-acid-inducible asparaginase II gene (ansB) showed that IHF and a component of the Arr-containing fraction (but not HU) interact with the corresponding ansB promoter.
The leucine-responsive regulatory protein of Escherichia coli negatively regulates transcription of ompC and micF and positively regulates translation of ompF.
The two major porins of Escherichia coli K-12 strains, OmpC and OmpF, are inversely regulated with respect to one another.
The expression of OmpC and OmpF has been shown to be influenced by the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp): two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of proteins from strains with and strains without a functional Lrp protein revealed that OmpC expression is increased in an lrp strain, while OmpF expression is decreased.
In agreement with these findings, we now present evidence that transcriptional (operon) fusions of lacZ+ to ompC and micF are negatively regulated by Lrp.
Lrp binds specifically to the intergenic region between micF and ompC, as indicated by mobility shift assays and by DNase I footprinting.
The expression of an ompF'-lacZ+ gene (translational) fusion is increased 3.7-fold in an lrp+ background compared with an lrp background, but expression of an ompF-lacZ+ operon fusion is not.
Studies of in vivo expression of the outer membrane porins during growth on glucose minimal medium showed that the OmpF/OmpC ratio is higher in lrp+ strains than it is in isogenic lrp strains.
The effect of Lrp was not seen in a strain containing a deletion of micF.
Our studies suggest that the positive effect of Lrp on OmpF expression stems from a negative effect of Lrp on the expression of micF, an antisense RNA that inhibits ompF translation.
Binding and transcriptional activation of non-flagellar genes by the Escherichia coli flagellar master regulator FlhD2C2.
The gene hierarchy directing biogenesis of peritrichous flagella on the surface of Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria is controlled by the heterotetrameric master transcriptional regulator FlhD(2)C(2).
To assess the extent to which FlhD(2)C(2) directly activates promoters of a wider regulon, a computational screen of the E. coli genome was used to search for gene-proximal DNA sequences similar to the 42-44 bp inverted repeat FlhD(2)C(2) binding consensus.
Nine representative non-flagellar promoter regions were all bound in vitro by active reconstituted FlhD(2)C(2) over the K(D) range 38-356 nM, and of the nine corresponding chromosomal promoter-lacZ fusions, those of the four genes b1904, b2446, wzz(fepE) and gltI showed up to 50-fold dependence on FlhD(2)C(2) in vivo.
In comparison, four representative flagella class II promoters bound FlhD(2)C(2) in the K(D) range 12-43 nM and were upregulated in vivo 30- to 990-fold.
The data indicate a wider FlhD(2)C(2) regulon, in which non-flagellar genes are bound and activated directly, albeit less strongly, by the same mechanism as that regulating the flagella gene hierarchy.
The ftsH gene, previously shown to code for an essential inner membrane protein with putative ATPase activity, is identical to hflB, a gene involved in the stability of the phage cII activator protein.
Expression of the degradative D-amino acid dehydrogenase (dad) operon is known to be increased when Escherichia coli is grown in the presence of D- or L-alanine.
Alanine is thought to act as an inducer to block the action of a postulated repressor.
This operon is also believed to be regulated by catabolite repression.
dad expression in a dad-lacZ operon fusion strain was increased four- to sevenfold when cells were grown in minimal medium containing alanine or leucine.
A strain lacking Lrp had high-level constitutive dad expression.
Gel retardation and footprinting studies revealed that Lrp binds in vitro to multiple sites over a large area in the dad promoter region.
This binding was reduced by alanine or leucine.
The formation of these transcripts was differentially regulated by cyclic AMP-cyclic AMP receptor protein complex, and each was strongly repressed by Lrp.
Alanine or leucine completely (for Tr1 and Tr2) or partially (for Tr3) reversed Lrp inhibition.
Site-directed mutagenesis of an Lrp binding site strongly reduced Lrp binding and prevented Lrp repression of dad transcription in vivo and in vitro.
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Lrp and alanine or leucine act directly to repress and induce, respectively, transcription of the dad operon.
Interaction at a distance between multiple operators controls the adjacent, divergently transcribed glpTQ-glpACB operons of Escherichia coli K-12.
The glp regulon of Escherichia coli encodes the proteins required for utilization of sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and its precursors.
Transcription of the divergently transcribed glpTQ and glpACB operons is initiated at sites separated by 132 base pairs (bp) of DNA.
These operons are controlled negatively by glp repressor and positively by the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex.
The locations of the binding sites for the glp repressor and for cAMP.CRP in the control regions of these operons were determined by DNase I footprinting.
Binding of the glp repressor protected the region -32 to -51 (OT) in the glpTQ promoter, which was also the binding site for cAMP.CRP.
Four repressor binding sites (-41 to -60 (OA1), -9 to -28 (OA2), +12 to -8 (OA3), and +52 to +33 (OA4)) and two cAMP.CRP binding sites (+11 to -11 and -30 to -51) were found in the glpACB promoter region.
The role of each operator was assessed by measuring repression in constructs where individual operators were altered by site-directed mutagenesis.
Alteration of OT did not significantly decrease repression of either operon.
Each of the glpACB operators contributed to repression of both operons.
These results suggest involvement of glpACB operator(s) in control of glpTQ expression perhaps via formation of a repression loop.
Evidence supporting this hypothesis was obtained by measuring the degree of repression of the glpTQ promoter in constructs containing 6- or 10-bp insertions between the glpTQ and glpACB operators.
A 6-bp insertion located within OA2 or between OT and OA1 eliminated repression of the glpTQ promoter, whereas significant repression was maintained in the case of a 10-bp insertion within OA2.
Autoregulation of PurR repressor synthesis and involvement of purR in the regulation of purB, purC, purL, purMN and guaBA expression in Escherichia coli.
The purR gene encodes a repressor (PurR) controlling the synthesis of the enzymes of purine biosynthesis.
Analysis of a purR-lacZ transcriptional fusion indicated that purR expression is autoregulated.
This was confirmed by gel retardation and DNaseI footprinting experiments, where two PurR-binding sites were identified in the transcribed part of purR.
Introduction of a purR mutation in wild-type and pur-lac fusion strains was found to abolish purine repression of all genes of the purine biosynthetic pathway except for purA.
Low-affinity sites for the activator NRI-P (NtrC-P) that map between the enhancer and the glnAp2 promoter were responsible for limiting promoter activity at high concentrations of NRI approximately P in intact cells and in an in vitro transcription system consisting of purified bacterial components.
That is, the low-affinity sites constitute a 'governor', limiting the maximum promoter activity.
As the governor sites are themselves far from the promoter, they apparently act either by preventing the formation of the activation DNA loop that brings the enhancer-bound activator and the promoter-bound polymerase into proximity or by preventing a productive interaction between the enhancer-bound activator and polymerase.
The combination of potent enhancer and governor sites at the glnAp2 promoter provides for efficient activation of the promoter when the activator concentration is low, while limiting the maximum level of promoter activity when the activator concentration is high.
Evolution of transcriptional regulation system through promiscuous coupling of regulatory proteins with operons; suggestion from protein sequence similarities in Escherichia coli.
From this comparison, it is found that similar regulatory proteins rarely regulate the transcription of similar protein genes.
As most of the highly similar proteins are considered to have diverged from a common ancestral protein, this finding strongly suggests the possibility that descendant regulatory proteins have been promiscuously coupled with descendant operons, independently of their ancestral regulator-regulon relationship, and that some of the couplings have been fixed by selection to form the present system of transcriptional regulation.
The compatibility of such promiscuous coupling with regulatory organization is illustrated in the carbohydrate transport systems and the succeeding metabolic pathways, whose organization is comprehensive in sending nutritious substances to the central path of glycolysis under different environmental conditions.
The quaternary structure of regulatory proteins undoubtedly plays an important role in the initiation of transcription and DNA replication.
From the examples presented in this article, it appears that the formation of certain nucleoprotein complexes implicated in transcription initiation might involve heterologous rather than isologous interactions, allowing differentiation between two classes of transcription activators.
Regulation of expression of the divergent ulaG and ulaABCDEF operons involved in LaAscorbate dissimilation in Escherichia coli.
The ula regulon, responsible for the utilization of L-ascorbate in Escherichia coli, is formed by two divergently transcribed operons, ulaG and ulaABCDEF.
The regulon is negatively regulated by a repressor of the DeoR family which is encoded by the constitutive gene ulaR located downstream of ulaG.
Full repression of the ula regulon requires simultaneous interaction of the repressor with both divergent promoters and seems to be dependent on repressor-mediated DNA loop formation, which is helped by the action of integration host factor.
Lack of either of the two sets of operators partially relieved the repression of the other operon; thus, each promoter is dependent on the UlaR operator sites of the other promoter to enhance repression.
Glucose represses the ula regulon via at least two mechanisms, one dependent on cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and the other (possibly inducer exclusion) independent of it.
Glucose effects mediated by other global regulators cannot be ruled out with the present information.
Changes in cAMP-CRP levels affected only the expression of the ulaABCDEF operon.
Cloning and analysis of the shiA gene, which encodes the shikimate transport system of escherichia coli K-12.
In Escherichia coli K-12, the shiA gene is involved in the uptake of shikimate.
The gene is predicted to encode a protein of 438 amino acids and lies adjacent to the amn gene.
Recombining an inactive form of the cloned gene into the chromosome creates mutants unable to transport shikimate.
Expression of the shiA gene does not appear to be regulated by the TyrR protein, a repressor/activator that controls the expression of other genes involved with the biosynthesis or transport of the aromatic amino acids.
Regulation of transcription of cell division genes in the Escherichia coli dcw cluster.
The Escherichia coli dcw cluster contains cell division genes, such as the phylogenetically ubiquitous ftsZ, and genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis.
Transcription in the cluster proceeds in the same direction as the progress of the replication fork along the chromosome.
Regulation is exerted at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.
The absence of transcriptional termination signals may, in principle, allow extension of the transcripts initiated at the up-stream promoter (mraZ1p) even to the furthest down-stream gene (envA).
In addition, the cluster contains other promoters individually regulated by cis- and trans-acting signals.
Dissociation of the expression of the ftsZ gene, located after ftsQ and A near the 3' end of the cluster, from its natural regulatory signals leads to an alteration in the physiology of cell division.
The complexities observed in the regulation of gene expression in the cluster may then have an important biological role.
Among them, LexA-binding SOS boxes have been found at the 5' end of the cluster, preceding promoters which direct the expression of ftsI (coding for PBP3, the penicillin-binding protein involved in septum formation).
A gearbox promoter, ftsQ1p, forms part of the signals regulating the transcription of ftsQ, A and Z.
It is an inversely growth-dependent mechanism driven by RNA polymerase containing sigma s, the factor involved in the expression of stationary phase-specific genes.
Although the dcw cluster is conserved to a different extent in a variety of bacteria, the regulation of gene expression, the presence or absence of individual genes, and even the essentiality of some of them, show variations in the phylogenetic scale which may reflect adaptation to specific life cycles.
In response to low oxygen levels, autophosphorylated ArcB phosphorylates ArcA, and the resulting phosphorylated ArcA (ArcA-P) functions as a transcriptional regulator of the genes necessary to maintain anaerobic growth.
DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that ArcA-P binds to the left region of the chromosomal origin, oriC.
Organization and regulation of the D-xylose operons in Escherichia coli K-12: XylR acts as a transcriptional activator.
The metabolism of D-xylose in Escherichia coli K-12 is known to be mediated by the xylAB gene.
An analysis with random transposon insertions revealed that the xyl genes are organized into two major transcriptional units, xylAB and xylFGHR, governed by the promoters PA and PF, respectively.
When studied with operon fusions to lacZ, the PA and PF promoters were activated by D-xylose and repressed by glucose.
In contrast, the PR promoter was not regulated by these sugars.
A mutation in xylR completely abolished expression from the PA and PF promoters, causing a defect in both growth and transport.
Binding of XylR to the xyl promoter was enhanced by the presence of D-xylose, suggesting that transcription was positively regulated by XylR.
In vivo footprinting analysis revealed that XylR binds to at least two DNA regions, IA and IF, each with a direct repeat.
It is very likely that XylR interacts with IA and IF as a dimer.
The proposed structure of xyl promoters is consistent with the regulation of xyl gene expression and with phenotypes of transposon insertions obtained in the promoter regions.
Collaborative regulation of Escherichia coli glutamate-dependent acid resistance by two AraC-like regulators, GadX and GadW (YhiW).
Previous work has revealed that the system is controlled by two sigma factors, two negative regulators (cyclic AMP receptor protein [CRP] and H-NS), and an AraC-like regulator called GadX.
Earlier evidence suggested that the GadX protein acts both as a positive and negative regulator of the gadA and gadBC genes depending on environmental conditions.
New data clarify this finding, revealing a collaborative regulation between GadX and another AraC-like regulator called GadW (previously YhiW).
GadX activates expression of gadA and gadBC at any pH, while GadW inhibits GadX-dependent activation.
Regulation of gadA and gadBC by either regulator requires an upstream, 20-bp GAD box sequence.
Northern blot analysis further indicates that GadW represses expression of gadX.
The results suggest a control circuit whereby GadW interacts with both the gadA and gadX promoters.
GadW clearly represses gadX and, in situations where GadX is missing, activates gadA and gadBC.
GadX, however, activates only gadA and gadBC expression.
CRP also represses gadX expression.
It does this primarily by repressing production of sigma S, the sigma factor responsible for gadX expression.
In fact, the acid induction of gadA and gadBC observed when rich-medium cultures enter stationary phase corresponds to the acid induction of sigma S production.
These complex control circuits impose tight rein over expression of the gadA and gadBC system yet provide flexibility for inducing acid resistance under many conditions that presage acid stress.
Repression of the Escherichia coli melR promoter by MelR: evidence that efficient repression requires the formation of a repression loop.
The Escherichia coli MelR protein is a transcription activator that, in the presence of melibiose, activates expression of the melAB operon by binding to four sites located just upstream of the melAB promoter.
MelR is encoded by the melR gene, which is expressed from a divergent transcript that starts 237 bp upstream of the melAB promoter transcript start point.
In a recent study, we have identified a fifth DNA site for MelR that overlaps the melR promoter transcript start and -10 region.
Here we show that MelR binding to this site can downregulate expression from the melR promoter; thus, MelR autoregulates its own expression.
Optimal repression of the melR promoter is observed in the absence of melibiose and requires one of the four other DNA sites for MelR at the melAB promoter.
The two MelR binding sites required for this optimal repression are separated by 177 bp.
We argue that, in the presence of melibiose, this loop is broken as the melAB promoter is activated.
However, in the presence of melibiose, the melR promoter can still be partially repressed by MelR binding to the site that overlaps the transcript start and -10 region.
DNA loop formation between Nag repressor molecules bound to its two operator sites is necessary for repression of the nag regulon of Escherichia coli in vivo.
Binding sites for the Nag repressor overlap the transcription start sites of the divergent nagE and nagB genes, such that the centres of the sites are separated by nine turns of the B-DNA helix.
Mutations which prevent repressor binding to either site or alter the phasing of the binding sites result in simultaneous derepression of both genes.
An additional mutation which restores the phasing of the two sites permits repression.
These observations show that repression is the result of co-operative binding of the repressor to its two sites, resulting in the formation of a loop of DNA.
The agaZVWEFASYBCDI gene cluster encodes the phosphotransferase systems and enzymes responsible for the uptake and metabolism of N-acetylgalactosamine and galactosamine in Escherichia coli.
Divergently transcribed from this gene cluster is the gene agaR encoding a transcriptional repressor belonging to the DeoR/GlpR family of transcriptional regulators.
All three promoters had elevated activity in the presence of N-acetylgalactosamine or galactosamine, were regulated in vivo by AgaR and possessed specific DNA-binding sites for AgaR upstream from the start sites of transcription as determined by DNase I footprinting.
In vivo analysis and DNase I footprinting indicated that the promoter specific for agaZ also requires activation by cAMP-CRP.
Escherichia coli possesses two systems, GntI and GntII, for gluconate uptake and catabolism, whose genes are regulated by GntR as a repressor and GntH as an activator, respectively.
Additionally, GntH exerts negative control of the GntI genes via the same binding element as that of GntR.
We thus examined whether GntR involves regulation of the GntII genes or not.
This regulation and the control by GntH were examined by using single-copy LACZ operon fusions and by RT-PCR, suggesting positive and negative regulation by GntR and positive regulation by GntH.
Moreover, the introduction of mutations into possible GntR-binding elements revealed that both regulators share at least one of the elements.
The results presented allow us to speculate that GntR initiates expression of the GntII genes, followed by their large induction by GntH when cells were grown in gluconate minimum medium.
As in the case of the GntI genes, such a cross-regulation between the GntI and GntII via the two regulators may be important for cells to grow with gluconate.
Effects of nitrate respiration on expression of the Arc-controlled operons encoding succinate dehydrogenase and flavin-linked L-lactate dehydrogenase.
Expression of sdhCDAB (encoding succinate dehydrogenase) and lctD (encoding the flavin-linked L-lactate dehydrogenase) is elevated aerobically and repressed anaerobically in Escherichia coli.
The repression is initiated by autophosphorylation of the sensor protein ArcB, followed by phosphoryl group transfer to the regulator ArcA.
ArcA-P, a global transcriptional regulator, then prevents sdh and lct expression.
Results presented here indicate that the increase of sdh and lct expression by nitrate depended on its chemical reduction, which in turn diminished the ArcA-P pool.
Unexpectedly, a mutation in the fnr gene (encoding a global regulator involved in anaerobic metabolism) also alleviated the anaerobic repressions.
Mutations in arcB or arcA were epistatic over that of fnr.
It is possible that Fnr also indirectly affects some of the other members of the arcA modulon, e.g., cyoABCDE (encoding the cytochrome o complex), cydAB (encoding the cytochrome d complex), and sodA (encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase).
Hierarchical control of anaerobic gene expression in Escherichia coli K-12: the nitrate-responsive NarX-NarL regulatory system represses synthesis of the fumarate-responsive DcuS-DcuR regulatory system.
Nitrate regulation is mediated by the NarX-NarL two-component system, which activates the transcription of operons encoding nitrate respiration enzymes and represses the transcription of operons for other anaerobic respiratory enzymes, including enzymes involved in fumarate respiration.
These are fumarate reductase (encoded by the frdABCD operon), fumarase B, which generates fumarate from malate, and the DcuB permease for fumarate, malate, and aspartate.
The transcription of the corresponding structural genes is activated by the DcuS-DcuR two-component system in response to fumarate or its dicarboxylate precursors.
We report results from preliminary transcription microarray experiments that revealed two previously unknown members of the NarL regulon: the aspA gene encoding aspartate-ammonia lyase, which generates fumarate; and the dcuSR operon encoding the dicarboxylate-responsive regulatory system.
Nitrate, acting through the NarX-NarL regulatory system, repressed the transcription of all three operons.
The overall results are consistent with the hypothesis that nitrate represses frdA operon transcription not only directly, by repressing frdA promoter activity, but also indirectly, by repressing dcuS promoter activity.
Synthesis of formate dehydrogenase coupled to formate hydrogenlyase activity in Escherichia coli was found to require the product of the fhlA gene.
Transcription of fdhF, the gene coding for the 80-kilodalton (kDa) selenopeptide of formate dehydrogenase, was not detected in an fhlA genetic background.
Mutations in the fhlA gene also abolished production of the hydrogenase activity associated with formate hydrogenlyase activity.
The fhlA gene resides next to the hydB gene at 59 min in the E. coli chromosome, and the two genes are transcribed in opposite directions.
The fhlA gene codes for a 78-kDa protein.
A neighboring gene, fdv, codes for an 82-kDa protein, and the physiological role of this gene product is unknown, although a role in H2 metabolism can be detected.
CueR (YbbI) of Escherichia coli is a MerR family regulator controlling expression of the copper exporter CopA.
We have shown that the open reading frame ybbI in the genomic sequence of Escherichia coli K-12 encodes the regulator of expression of the copper-exporting ATPase, CopA.
In vivo studies showed that ybbI (designated cueR for copper export regulator gene) was required for copper tolerance during growth, that disruption of cueR caused loss of copA expression and that copA gene expression was regulated by cueR and by copper or silver ions.
Expression of a lacZ reporter gene under the control of the copA promoter was approximately proportional to the concentration of cupric ions in the medium, but increased more rapidly in response to silver ion concentrations.
The start of the copA transcript was located by primer extension mapping, and DNase I protection assays showed that the CueR protein binds in vitro to a dyad symmetrical sequence within a 19 bp spacer sequence in the copA promoter.
CueR binding occurs in vitro in both the presence and the absence of RNA polymerase with or without copper ions present but, in the presence of CueR, RNA polymerase and copper ions, permanganate-sensitive transcription complexes were formed.
Positive and negative control of ompB transcription in Escherichia coli by cyclic AMP and the cyclic AMP receptor protein.
The ompB operon encodes OmpR and EnvZ, two proteins that are necessary for the expression and osmoregulation of the OmpF and OmpC porins in Escherichia coli.
ompB expression in an ompB-lacZ chromosomal fusion strain was increased two- to fivefold when cells were grown in medium containing poor carbon sources or with added cyclic AMP.
In vivo primer extension analysis indicated that this control is complex and involves both positive and negative effects by cyclic AMP-CRP on multiple ompB promoters.
In vitro footprinting showed that cyclic AMP-CRP binds to a 34-bp site centered at -53 and at -75 in relation to the start sites of the major transcripts that are inhibited and activated, respectively, by this complex.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the crp binding site provided evidence that this site is necessary for the in vivo regulation of ompB expression by cyclic AMP.
Control of the ompB operon by cyclic AMP-CRP may account for the observed regulation of the formation of OmpF and OmpC by this complex (N.W. Scott and C.R. Harwood, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 9:95-98, 1980).
The tdh promoter of Escherichia coli is induced seven- to eightfold when cells are grown in the presence of exogenous leucine.
A scheme was devised to select mutants that exhibited high constitutive expression of the tdh promoter.
The mutations in these strains were shown to lie within a previously identified gene (lrp) that encodes Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein).
Disruption of a 12-bp presumptive target sequence found in this region of tdh resulted in constitutively derepressed expression from the tdh promoter.
No Lrp consensus target sequence was present upstream of serA, suggesting that Lrp acts indirectly on the serA promoter.
A previously described mutation in a leucine-responsive trans-acting factor, LivR (J.J. Anderson, S.C. Quay, and D.L. Oxender, J. Bacteriol. 126:80-90, 1976), resulted in constitutively repressed expression from the tdh promoter and constitutively induced expression from the serA promoter.
The ArcAB two-component system of Escherichia coli regulates the aerobic/anaerobic expression of genes that encode respiratory proteins whose synthesis is coordinated during aerobic/anaerobic cell growth.
These 175 genes clustered into eight expression patterns and represent genes involved in a large number of cell processes, including small molecule biosynthesis, macromolecular synthesis, and aerobic/anaerobic respiration and fermentation.
The strict statistical analyses that we have performed on our data allow us to predict that 1139 genes in the E. coli genome are regulated either directly or indirectly by the ArcA protein with a 99% confidence level.
GadE (YhiE): a novel activator involved in the response to acid environment in Escherichia coli.
Here, new insight is brought to the regulation of the acid response in Escherichia coli.
Overexpression of yhiE, similarly to overexpression of gadX, a known regulator of glutamate decarboxylase expression, leads to increased resistance of E. coli strains under high acid conditions, suggesting that YhiE is a regulator of gene expression in the acid response.
In vitro experiments with GadE purified protein provided evidence that this regulator binds to the promoter region of these target genes.
The gene encoding the periplasmic cyclophilin homologue, PPIase A, in Escherichia coli, is expressed from four promoters, three of which are activated by the cAMP-CRP complex and negatively regulated by the CytR repressor.
The rot gene in Escherichia coli encodes PPIase A, a periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase with homology to the cyclophilin family of proteins.
Here it is demonstrated that rot is expressed in a complex manner from four overlapping promoters and that the rot regulatory region is unusually compact, containing a close array of sites for DNA-binding proteins.
The three most upstream rot promoters are activated by the global gene regulatory cAMP-CRP complex and negatively regulated by the CytR repressor protein.
Activation of these three promoters occurs by binding of cAMP-CRP to two sites separated by 53 bp.
Moreover, one of the cAMP-CRP complexes is involved in the activation of both a Class I and a Class II promoter.
Repression takes place by the formation of a CytR/cAMP-CRP/DNA nucleoprotein complex consisting of the two cAMP-CRP molecules and CytR bound in between.
The two regulators bind co-operatively to the DNA overlapping the three upstream promoters, simultaneously quenching the cAMP-CRP activator function.
Two different modes of transcription repression of the Escherichia coli acetate operon by IclR.
IclR is a repressor for the Escherichia coli aceBAK operon, which encodes isocitrate lyase (aceB), malate synthase (aceA) and isocitrate dehydroge-nase kinase/phosphorylase (aceK) in the glyoxylate bypass.
IclR also represses the expression of iclR in an autogenous manner.
DNase I footprinting and in vitro transcription assays indicated that IclR binds to an IclR box (-21 to +14), which overlaps the iclR promoter and thus competes with the RNA polymerase for DNA binding, leading to transcription repression.
In the case of the aceBAK operon, IclR binds to IclR box II between -52 and -19 of the aceB promoter and interferes with binding of the RNA polymerase to this promoter.
A secondary IclR binding site (IclR box I) was identified between -125 and -99 of the aceB promoter.
IclR binds to this IclR box I even after formation of the aceB promoter open complex and, moreover, induces disassembly of the open complex, leading to repression of aceB transcription.
In parallel, the location of the C-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase alpha subunit (alphaCTD) on DNA is shifted close to the IclR box I, indicating that direct interaction between the alphaCTD and the IclR box I-associated IclR caused the repression.
It was found that the TCA cycle genes, icd, gltA, sucC, and sdhC are repressed by ArcA while Fnr has a minor or no effect on the expression of these genes under microaerobic conditions.
The expression levels of the electron transfer chain genes, nuoA, ndh, and ubiE, were not significantly affected by either ArcA or Fnr regulation proteins, while a lower expression of cydA (up to 9-fold lower) and a higher expression of cyoA (up to 31-fold higher) were observed in cultures of the arcA mutant strain compared to those of the wild type.
The periplasmic TorT protein is required for trimethylamine N-oxide reductase gene induction in Escherichia coli.
Expression of the Escherichia coli torCAD operon, which encodes the trimethylamine N-oxide reductase system, is regulated by the presence of trimethylamine N-oxide through the action of the TorR response regulator.
We have identified an additional gene, torT, located just downstream from the torR gene, which is necessary for torCAD structural operon expression.
Insertion within the torT gene dramatically reduced the expression of a torA'-'lacZ fusion, while presence of the gene in trans restored the wild-type phenotype.
Overproduction of TorR in a torT strain resulted in partial constitutive expression of the torA'-'lacZ fusion, suggesting that TorR acts downstream from TorT.
The torT gene codes for a 35.7-kDa periplasmic protein which presents some homology with the periplasmic ribose-binding protein of E. coli.
Differential regulation by the homologous response regulators NarL and NarP of Escherichia coli K-12 depends on DNA binding site arrangement.
The NarL and NarP proteins are homologous response regulators of Escherichia coli that control the expression of several operons in response to nitrate and nitrite.
However, some operons are regulated by NarL alone, whereas others are controlled by both NarL and NarP.
In this study, DNase I footprinting experiments with the fdnG, nirB and nrfA control regions revealed that NarP only binds to heptamer sequences organized as an inverted repeat with a 2 bp spacing (7-2-7 sites).
The NarL protein also binds to these 7-2-7 sites but, unlike NarP, also recognizes heptamers in other arrangements.
These results provide an explanation for the regulation of some operons by NarL alone and for the different effects of NarL and NarP at common target operons, such as fdnG and nrfA.
Increasing the spacing to four or more basepairs abolished NarP binding and significantly reduced NarL binding.
The NarL protein also had a reduced binding affinity for heptamers adjacent to the 7-n-7 heptamer pair, suggesting a decrease in cooperative interactions.
In conclusion, we propose that 7-2-7 sites are preferred by both NarL and NarP.
NarL can also recognize other binding site arrangements, an ability that appears to be lacking in NarP.
The Escherichia coli CpxA-CpxR envelope stress response system regulates expression of the porins ompF and ompC.
Screening of colonies by fluorescence microscopy revealed numerous mutants that exhibited interesting patterns of porin expression.
One mutant harbored an insertion in the gene encoding the histidine kinase CpxA, the sensor for a two-component signaling system that responds to envelope stress.
The cpxA mutant exhibited increased transcription of ompC and a very strong decrease in transcription of ompF under conditions in which acetyl phosphate levels were high.
Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that this phenotype is dependent on phosphorylation of the response regulator CpxR and that activation of CpxA in wild-type cells results in similar regulation of porin expression.
Using DNase I footprinting, we demonstrated that CpxR binds upstream of both the ompF and ompC promoters.
However, at least for the classical porins OmpF and OmpC, our results show that the Cpx envelope stress response system plays a role in regulating their expression.
marA locus causes decreased expression of OmpF porin in multiple-antibiotic-resistant (Mar) mutants of Escherichia coli.
Mar (multiple antibiotic resistant) mutants of Escherichia coli express chromosomally mediated resistance to a variety of structurally unrelated hydrophilic and hydrophobic antibiotics.
Insertion of transposon Tn5 into the marA locus at min 34.05 on the chromosome completely reverses the Mar phenotype (A.M. George and S.B. Levy, J Bacteriol 155:531-540, 1983).
We found that among changes in the outer membrane of Mar mutants, porin OmpF was greatly reduced, although Mar mutants were more resistant than cells lacking only OmpF.
Transduction of the marA region from a Mar strain, but not a wild-type strain, led to loss of OmpF.
P1 transduction of marA::Tn5 into a Mar mutant partially restored OmpF levels.
Therefore, OmpF reduction required a mutation in the marA region.
Mar mutants of an ompF-lacZ operon fusion strain expressed 50 to 75% of the beta-galactosidase activity of the isogenic non-Mar parental strain, while Mar mutants of a protein fusion strain expressed less than 10% of the enzyme activity in the non-Mar strain.
These changes were completely reversed by insertion of marA::Tn5.
Although some transcriptional control may have been present, OmpF reduction appeared to occur primarily by a posttranscriptional mechanism.
Expression of micF, which lowers ompF mRNA levels, was elevated in Mar strains, as revealed by a micF-lacZ fusion.
Studies with strains deleted for the micF locus showed that the marA-dependent reduction of OmpF required an intact micF locus.
Our findings suggest that the marA locus directly or indirectly increases micF expression, causing a posttranscriptional decrease in ompF mRNA and reduced amounts of OmpF.
The arginine repressor is essential for plasmid-stabilizing site-specific recombination at the ColE1 cer locus.
The heritable stability in Escherichia coli of the multicopy plasmid ColE1 and its natural relatives requires that the plasmids be maintained in the monomeric state.
Plasmid multimers, that arise through recA-dependent homologous recombination, are normally converted to monomers by a site-specific recombination system that acts at a specific plasmid site (cer in ColE1).
No plasmid functions that act at this site have been identified.
In contrast, two unlinked E.coli genes that encode functions required for cer-mediated site-specific recombination have been identified.
Here we describe the isolation and characterization of one such gene (xerA) and show it to be identical to the gene encoding the repressor of the arginine biosynthetic genes (argR).
The argR protein binds to cer DNA both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of arginine.
We believe this binding is required to generate a higher order protein-DNA complex within the recombinational synapse.
Altered regulation of the recA gene in Escherichia coli strains carrying a recA-linked suppressor of lexA.
A mutant strain of E. coli displaying altered regulation of the recA gene was isolated as a revertant of a lexA3 recA200 double mutant which showed improved DNA repair and recombination functions.
Aspartate is one of several attractant ligands normally sensed by Tar and it interacts with Taz to induce OmpR-dependent transcription from the ompC promoter--albeit with reduced sensitivity relative to the chemotactic response it evokes via Tar.
By combining Taz with a reporter system that expresses green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the ompC promoter, we were able to examine the interaction of Taz with all 20 natural amino acids.
Some amino acids (Leu, Met, Val and Ser) reduced GFP expression, which in the case of leucine is likely attributed to a direct effect on the receptor, rather than an indirect effect through the leucine responsive protein (Lrp).
Differential control by IHF and cAMP of two oppositely oriented genes, hpt and gcd, in Escherichia coli: significance of their partially overlapping regulatory elements.
The hpt gene, which encodes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase, is located next to, but transcribed in the opposite direction to, the gcd gene, which codes for a membrane-bound glucose dehydrogenase, at 3.1 min on the Escherichia coli genome.
The involvement of IHF and cAMP-CRP, as well as the corresponding putative cis-acting elements, in the expression of the two genes was investigated by using lacZ operon fusions.
In an adenylate cyclase-deficient strain, addition of cAMP increased the expression of hpt and reduced the expression of gcd.
In agreement with this observation, the introduction of mutations into the putative binding element for the cAMP-CRP complex enhanced the expression of gcd.
In contrast, mutations introduced into the putative IHF-binding elements increased the level of hpt expression.
Thus, the expression of the two genes is regulated in a mutually exclusive manner.
Additional experiments with mutations at the -10 sequence of the gcd promoter suggest that the binding of RNA polymerase to the hpt promoter interferes with the interaction of RNA polymerase with the gcd promoter, and vice versa.
Inducible overexpression of the Escherichia coli gal operon in the absence of the Gal repressor is known as ultrainduction.
The requirement of induction can be eliminated by mutation of a new locus, galS, resulting in constitutive and ultrainduced levels of gal expression.
Characterization of the galS gene and its product has revealed an isorepressor of the gal regulon.
The Gal isorepressor is a protein of 346 amino acid residues whose amino acid sequence and cellular function, as described here, are very similar to that of Gal repressor, encoded by the galR gene.
Transcription from different promoters of the gal regulon, galP1, galP2 and mglP, was examined by primer extension and reverse transcription of mRNA isolated from strains containing mutations in galR and/or galS.
In strains containing a galS mutation, overexpression of gal message occurred only in the presence of inducer, while mgl message was constitutively derepressed.
The galS mutation also constitutively derepressed an mglA::lacZ fusion, demonstrating that GalS is the mgl repressor.
Extensive overproduction of the AdhE protein by rng mutations depends on mutations in the cra gene or in the Cra-box of the adhE promoter.
Escherichia coli RNase G encoded by the rng gene is involved in degradation of adhE mRNA.
Overproduction of the AdhE protein by rng mutants was found to depend on the genetic background of strains derived from DC272 (adhC81) or MC1061.
We found that DC272 carried a point mutation in the Cra-binding site of the adhE promoter.
The Cra protein encoded by the cra gene is known to act as a repressor of adhE.
Overproduction of AdhE in the MC1061 background was reversed to the wild-type levels by introduction of a plasmid carrying the cra(+) gene.
These results indicated that expression of the adhE gene was regulated transcriptionally by Cra and posttranscriptionally by RNase G.
Action at a distance for negative control of transcription of the glpD gene encoding sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli K-12.
Aerobic sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a cytoplasmic membrane-associated respiratory enzyme encoded by the glpD gene of Escherichia coli.
The glpD operon is tightly controlled by cooperative binding of the glp repressor to tandem operators (O(D)1 and O(D)2) that cover the -10 promoter element and 30 bp downstream of the transcription start site.
The two internal operators bound the glp repressor in the presence or absence of the tandem operators (O(D)1 and O(D)2) in vitro, as shown by DNase I footprinting.
The response of this fusion to the glp repressor was compared with those of fusion constructs in which O(D)3 and O(D)4 were inactivated by either deletion or site-directed mutagenesis.
It was found that the repression conferred by binding of the glp repressor to O(D)1 and O(D)2 was increased five- to sevenfold upon introduction of the internal operators.
A regulatory role for HU was suggested when it was found that repressor-mediated control of glpD transcription was increased fourfold in strains containing HU compared with that of strains deficient in HU.
The effect of HU was apparent only in the presence of all four glpD operators.
The results suggest that glpD is controlled by formation of a repression loop between the tandem and internal operators.
HU may assist repression by bending the DNA to facilitate loop formation.
The LysR-type transcriptional regulator CysB controls the repression of hslJ transcription in Escherichia coli.
The LysR-type transcriptional regulator (LTTR) CysB is a transcription factor in Escherichia coli cells, where as a homotetramer it binds the target promoter regions and activates the genes involved in sulphur utilization and sulphonate-sulphur metabolism, while negatively autoregulating its own transcription.
The hslJ gene was found to be negatively regulated by CysB and directly correlated with novobiocin resistance of the bacterium.
cysB mutants showed upregulation of the hslJ : : lacZ gene fusion and exhibited increased novobiocin resistance.
The hslJ promoter region was defined by employing different hslJ-lacZ operon fusions, and transcription of the hslJ gene was shown to be subject to both repression imposed by the CysB regulator and direct or indirect autogenous negative control.
These two regulations compete to some extent but they are not mutually exclusive.
CysB acts as a direct repressor of hslJ transcription and binds the hslJ promoter region that carries the putative CysB repressor site.
This CysB binding, apparently responsible for repression, is enhanced in the presence of the ligand N-acetylserine (NAS), hitherto considered to be a positive cofactor in CysB-mediated gene regulations.
Interallelic complementation of characterized CysB mutants I33N and S277Ter partially restored the repression of hslJ transcription and the consequent novobiocin sensitivity, but did not complement the cysteine auxotrophy.
The role of the trehalose system in regulating the maltose regulon of Escherichia coli.
The maltose regulon consists of 10 genes encoding an ABC transporter for maltose and maltodextrins as well as enzymes necessary for their degradation.
MalK, the energy-transducing subunit of the transport system, acts phenotypically as a repressor of MalT, the transcriptional activator of the mal genes.
The insertion had occurred in treR encoding the repressor of the trehalose system.
The loss of TreR function led to derepression of treB encoding an enzymeIITre of the PTS for trehalose and of treC encoding TreC, the cytoplasmic trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase.
In addition, derepression of TreC by itself caused induction of the maltose system, and a mutant lacking TreC was reduced in the uninduced level of mal gene expression indicating synthesis of endogenous inducer by TreC.
Multiple regulation involved in the expression of the uxuR regulatory gene in Escherichia coli K-12.
We have isolated a strain carrying a fusion of the beta-galactosidase structural gene to the promoter of the uxuR regulatory gene with the aid of the Casadaban Mud (Aprlac) phage.
The uxuR-lacZ fusion strain was also used to examine the regulation of expression from the uxuR promoter.
It was observed that an increase in the copy number of the uxuR gene results in an increased repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis.
Overproduction of the exuR repressor also caused a decrease of the beta-galactosidase level.
In all cases, the repression of beta-galactosidase synthesis was accompanied by a stronger repression of uxuB gene product synthesis.
These results indicate that the expression of the uxuR gene is repressed by its own product but also by the exuR repressor.
The gene encoding GcvA, the trans-acting regulatory protein for the Escherichia coli glycine cleavage enzyme system, has been sequenced.
The gcvA locus contains an open reading frame of 930 nucleotides that could encode a protein with a molecular mass of 34.4 kDa, consistent with the results of minicell analysis indicating that GcvA is a polypeptide of approximately 33 kDa.
A chromosomal deletion of gcvA resulted in the inability of cells to activate the expression of a gcvT-lacZ gene fusion when grown in the presence of glycine and an inability to repress gcvT-lacZ expression when grown in the presence of inosine.
The regulation of gcvA was examined by constructing a gcvA-lacZ gene fusion in which beta-galactosidase synthesis is under the control of the gcvA regulatory region.
Although gcvA expression appears to be autogenously regulated over a two- to threefold range, it is neither induced by glycine nor repressed by inosine.
Independent regulation of the divergent Escherichia coli nrfA and acsP1 promoters by a nucleoprotein assembly at a shared regulatory region.
Expression from the Escherichia coli nrfA promoter (pnrfA) is activated by both the FNR protein (an anaerobically triggered transcription activator) and the NarL or NarP proteins (transcription activators triggered by nitrite and nitrate).
Under anaerobic conditions, FNR binds to a site centred at position -41.5 at pnrfA and activates transcription.
Further activation, induced by the presence of nitrite, results from the binding of NarL and NarP to a site centred at position -74.5.
A second promoter (pacsP1), which directs transcription into the adjacent gene encoding acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (acs), is overlapping and divergent to pnrfA.
Despite extensive overlap of regulatory elements, pnrfA and pacsP1 are regulated independently.
We demonstrate that at least two nucleoid-associated factors bind to the nrfA-acs intergenic region.
The Fis protein binds to a site centred at position -15 (in relation to pnrfA transcription), whereas the IHF protein binds to a site centred at position -54.
Both Fis and IHF repress in vivo expression from pacsP1, but have smaller repressive effects on expression from pnrfA.
Gel retardation assays were used to investigate the pairwise binding of FNR, NarL, Fis and IHF proteins to the nrfA-acs intergenic region.
The binding of NarL and IHF is mutually exclusive, whereas all other combinations can bind simultaneously.
Experiments in which deletions and point mutations were introduced into the upstream region of pnrfA demonstrated that an additional factor must bind upstream to inhibit FNR-dependent transcription.
We conclude that the nrfA-acs intergenic region is folded into an ordered nucleoprotein structure that permits the two divergent promoters to be regulated independently in response to different physiological signals.
Action at a distance for glp repressor control of glpTQ transcription in Escherichia coli K-12.
The adjacent, divergently transcribed glpACB and glpTQ operons of Escherichia coli encode the anaerobic glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glycerol 3-phosphate transporter/phosphodiesterase, respectively.
These operons are negatively controlled by glp repressor binding to operators that overlap the glpA promoter elements.
The response of this fusion to the glp repressor was compared to fusion constructs in which OT1 and OT3 were inactivated, either by deletion or by site-directed mutagenesis.
It was found that repression of glpT conferred by binding of glp repressor to glpA operators was increased about three- to fourfold upon introduction of the remote glpT operators.
A regulatory role for IHF was demonstrated by showing that repression of glpT mediated by GlpR was decreased about twofold in strains deficient in IHF and that mutations in IHF1 and/or IHF2 decreased repression about two- to threefold.
The effect of IHF was apparent only when the remote operators were present.
All of the results are consistent with a model of repression involving GlpR binding simultaneously to the glpA and remote glpT operators, with intervening DNA forming a loop.
The narL gene product activates the nitrate reductase operon and represses the fumarate reductase and trimethylamine N-oxide reductase operons in Escherichia coli.
Thus O2 prevents induction of nitrate, fumarate, and Me3NO reductases, and nitrate curtails the induction of fumarate and Me3NO reductases.
Under anaerobic conditions the narL gene product, in the presence of nitrate, is known to activate transcription of the narC operon, which encodes nitrate reductase.
This study shows that the same product plays a role in the repression by nitrate of the operons (frd and tor) that encode fumarate and Me3NO reductases.
In contrast, the anaerobic repression of ethanol dehydrogenase by nitrate does not require the narL product.
Expression of narL does not require the fnr gene product, a pleiotropic activator that is required for full expression of narC, frd, and tor.
Binding of the TorR regulator to cis-acting direct repeats activates tor operon expression.
The expression of the Escherichia coli torCAD operon, which encodes the anaerobically expressed trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) reductase respiratory system, requires the presence of TMAO in the medium.
The response regulator, TorR, has recently been identified as the regulatory protein that controls the expression of the torCAD operon in response to TMAO.
Alteration by base substitutions of any of the four tor boxes in a plasmid containing a torC'-lacZ fusion dramatically reduces TorR-dependent torC expression.
In addition, deletion of the distal tor box (box1) abolishes torC induction whereas the presence of a DNA fragment starting three bases upstream from box1 suffices for normal torC expression.
Footprinting and gel-retardation experiments unambiguously demonstrated that TorR binds to the torC regulatory region.
Three distinct regions are protected by TorR binding.
Binding to the upstream tor boxes (box1 and box2) appears to be stronger than binding to the downstream tor boxes (box3 and box4) since only the upstream region is protected at the lower concentration of TorR used in the footprinting experiments.
We propose a model in which multiple binding sites (i.e. the tor boxes) contribute to the formation of a nucleoprotein complex, but only one particular proximal site positions TorR properly so that it interacts with RNA polymerase.
We have identified a novel regulator, termed MlrA, that is required for curli production and extracellular matrix formation.
The rpoS gene, encoding a known positive regulator of curli synthesis, and the E. coli open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function, yehV, identified on each of these cosmids, respectively, conferred curli production and HA to E. coli HB101.
HA and curli production by strain chi7122 were abolished by disruption of rpoS, mlrA or csgA, the curli subunit gene.
Both csgD and csgBA transcription, required for expression of curli, were inactive in an mlrA mutant grown under conditions that promote curli production.
Analysis of mlrA-lac operon fusions demonstrated that mlrA was positively regulated by rpoS.
However, inactivation of mlrA did not affect curli production and aggregative morphology in an upregulated curli producing S. typhimurium derivative containing a temperature- and RpoS-independent agfD promoter region.
These results indicate that MlrA is a newly defined transcriptional regulator of csgD/agfD that acts as a positive regulator of RpoS-dependent curli and extracellular matrix production by E. coli and S. typhimurium.
Interdependence of activation at rhaSR by cyclic AMP receptor protein, the RNA polymerase alpha subunit C-terminal domain, and rhaR.
The Escherichia coli rhaSR operon encodes two AraC family transcription activators, RhaS and RhaR, and is activated by RhaR in the presence of L-rhamnose.
beta-Galactosidase assays of various rhaS-lacZ promoter fusions combined with mobility shift assays indicated that a cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) site located at -111.5 is also required for full activation of rhaSR expression.
To address the mechanisms of activation by CRP and the RNA polymerase alpha-subunit C-terminal domain (alpha-CTD) at rhaSR, we tested the effects of alanine substitutions in CRP activating regions 1 and 2, overexpression of a truncated version of alpha (alpha-Delta235), and alanine substitutions throughout alpha-CTD.
We found that DNA-contacting residues in alpha-CTD are required for full activation, and for simplicity, we discuss alpha-CTD as a third activator of rhaSR.
CRP and RhaR could each partially activate transcription in the absence of the other two activators, and alpha-CTD was not capable of activation alone.
In the case of CRP, this suggests that this activation involves neither an alpha-CTD interaction nor cooperative binding with RhaR, while in the case of RhaR, this suggests the likelihood of direct interactions with core RNA polymerase.
We also found that CRP, RhaR, and alpha-CTD each have synergistic effects on activation by the others, suggesting direct or indirect interactions among all three.
The magnitude of the synergistic effects was usually greater with just two activators than with all three, suggesting possible redundancies in the mechanisms of activation by CRP, alpha-CTD, and RhaR.
Selective regulation of ptsG expression by Fis.
Transcription of ptsG encoding glucose-specific permease, enzyme IICB(Glc), in Escherichia coli is initiated from two promoters, P1 and P2.
ptsG transcription is repressed by Mlc, a glucose-inducible regulator of carbohydrate metabolism.
The regulation of ptsG P1 transcription is also under positive control by cyclic AMP receptor protein and cyclic AMP complex (CRP.cAMP) as observed in other Mlc regulon.
We report here that Fis, one of the nucleoid-associated proteins, plays a key role in glucose induction of Mlc regulon.
ptsG transcription was induced when wild-type cells were grown in the presence of glucose.
However, in a fis mutant, the basal level of ptsG transcription was higher but decreased when cells were grown in the presence of glucose, which implies the possibility of regulatory interactions among Fis, Mlc, and CRP.cAMP.
Footprinting experiments with various probes and transcription assays revealed that Fis assists both Mlc repression and CRP.cAMP activation of ptsG P1 through the formation of Fis.CRP.Mlc or Fis.CRP nucleoprotein complexes at ptsG P1 promoter depending on the availability of glucose in the growth medium.
ptsG P2 transcription was inhibited by Fis and Mlc.
Tighter Mlc repression and enhanced CRP.cAMP activation of ptsG P1 by Fis enable cells to regulate Mlc regulon efficiently by selectively controlling the concentration of enzyme IICB(Glc) that modulates Mlc activity.
Expression of glnA in Escherichia coli is regulated at tandem promoters.
We have determined that the glnA gene of the complex glnALG operon of Escherichia coli is transcribed from tandem promoters.
Expression from the upstream promoter, glnAp1, requires the catabolite activating protein, is repressed by nitrogen regulator I (NRI), the product of glnG, and produces a transcript with an untranslated leader of 187 nucleotides.
Expression from the downstream promoter, glnAp2, requires NRI as well as the glnF product; full expression also requires growth in a nitrogen-limited environment.
We also provide evidence that the function of the glnL product is to mediate the interconversion of NRI between a form capable of activating glnAp2 and an inactive form in response to changes in the intracellular concentration of ammonia.
FruR-mediated transcriptional activation at the ppsA promoter of Escherichia coli.
The start site of transcription of the ppsA gene, whose expression is controlled by the regulatory protein FruR in Escherichia coli, was determined by primer extension of in vivo transcripts.
The interactions of the ppsA promoter with either RNA polymerase or FruR factor were analysed by the base removal method.
(ii) FruR binds to a target DNA region centered around position -45.5 upstream of the ppsA gene.
In addition, circular permutation analysis showed that, upon binding to its site, FruR induces a sharp bend of 120 degrees in the DNA helix, which suggests a crucial involvement of FruR-induced bending in ppsA promoter activation.
The alpha[L262A], alpha[R265A] and alpha[N268A] substitutions, which caused the most drastic reduction in the FruR-mediated activation of the ppsA promoter, had previously been shown to inhibit the upstream element-mediated activation at the rrnBP1 promoter.
Use of in vitro gene fusions to study the uxuR regulatory gene in Escherichia coli K-12: direction of transcription and regulation of its expression.
The uxuAB operon is composed of two genes coding for enzymes involved in hexuronate degradation.
This operon is negatively controlled by the uxuR and exuR regulatory gene products.
Fusions that brought lac gene expression under the control of transcriptional and translational signals within the uxuR gene were used to study uxuR regulation.
The gene is transcribed counterclockwise on the standard Escherichia coli map, as is the uxuAB operon.
Introduction in trans of a compatible plasmid carrying a wild-type uxuR gene in the lac fusion plasmid containing strain resulted in a decrease of beta-galactosidase synthesis.
It was concluded that expression of the uxuR gene itself is repressed by its own product.
The two other types of regulation found in the uxuAB operon, i.e., induction by fructuronate and catabolite control, also apply to the uxuR gene, whereas repression by the exuR repressor does not seem to occur for the uxuR gene.
Induction of manganese-containing superoxide dismutase in anaerobic Escherichia coli by diamide and 1,10-phenanthroline: sites of transcriptional regulation.
Transcriptional regulation of the sodA gene, a member of the soxRS regulon encoding the manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD; superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.15.1.1) of Escherichia coli, was examined in a variety of regulatory mutants.
A strain of E. coli bearing a fusion of the soxS promoter to lacZ was used to demonstrate that both diamide and 1,10-phenanthroline caused anaerobic activation of soxS transcription.
These results indicate that (i) both diamide and 1,10-phenanthroline induce the soxRS regulon anaerobically by stimulation of soxS transcription; (ii) diamide, but not metal chelators, also induces MnSOD biosynthesis by a soxRS-independent mechanism, perhaps mediated by effects on fur, arcA, or fnr-mediated repression of sodA; and (iii) the soxRS locus contains a metal-binding component and is responsive to the redox status of the cell.
Escherichia coli RcsA, a positive activator of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide synthesis, functions To activate its own expression.
Capsule (cps) gene expression in Escherichia coli is controlled by a complex network of regulators.
Transcription of the cps operon is controlled by at least two positive regulators, RcsA and RcsB.
We show here that RcsA functions to activate its own expression, as seen by the 100-fold-increased expression of a rcsA::lacZ transcriptional fusion in strains with high levels of RcsA protein, either due to a mutation in lon or due to overexpression of RcsA from a multicopy plasmid.
Expression of the rcsA::lacZ fusion is increased by but not dependent on the presence of RcsB.
In addition, the effects of H-NS and RcsB on the expression of rcsA are independent of each other.
A sequence motif, conserved between the E. coli cps promoter and the Erwinia amylovora ams promoter and previously shown to be the RcsA-RcsB binding site, was identified in the rcsA promoter region and shown to be required for high-level expression of rcsA.
Regulation of Escherichia coli K-12 hexuronate system genes: exu regulon
Phosphorylation of OmpR by the osmosensor EnvZ modulates expression of the ompF and ompC genes in Escherichia coli.
EnvZ and OmpR, the regulatory proteins for ompF and ompC expression in Escherichia coli, belong to a modulator-effector family of regulatory proteins which are essential for the response to environmental signals.
We also demonstrate that the phosphate group can, in turn, be transferred to the transcription activator protein OmpR.
Furthermore, in a delta envZ strain of E. coli, containing the envZ Val-243 plasmid, ompC expression is elevated 7-fold relative to that found in cells carrying the wild-type envZ plasmid.
Based on these results we propose a model in which the phosphorylated state of OmpR modulates the expression of the ompF and ompC genes.
pH-Dependent modulation of cyclic AMP levels and GadW-dependent repression of RpoS affect synthesis of the GadX regulator and Escherichia coli acid resistance.
Transcription of the genes encoding the glutamate decarboxylases and the substrate-product antiporter required for this system is induced under a variety of conditions, including the stationary phase and a low pH.
In this report we present evidence that there is a regulatory loop involving cross-repression of two AraC-like regulators, GadX and GadW, that can either assist or interfere with GadE activation of the gad decarboxylase and antiporter genes, depending on the culture conditions.
Balancing cross-repression appears to be dependent on cAMP and the cAMP regulator protein (CRP).
The control loop involves the GadX protein repressing the expression of gadW and the GadW protein repressing or inhibiting RpoS, which is the alternative sigma factor that drives transcription of gadX.
CRP and cAMP appear to influence GadX-GadW cross-repression from outside the loop by inhibiting production of RpoS.
We found that GadW represses the decarboxylase genes in minimal medium and that growth under acidic conditions lowers the intracellular cAMP levels.
These results indicate that CRP and cAMP can mediate pH control over gadX expression and, indirectly, expression of the decarboxylase genes.
Mutational or physiological lowering of cAMP levels increases the level of RpoS and thereby increases the production of GadX.
Higher GadX levels, in turn, repress gadW and contribute to induction of the gad decarboxylase genes.
The presence of multiple pH control pathways governing expression of this acid resistance system is thought to reflect different environmental routes to a low pH.
The expression ratios of a total of 232 genes were <0.75 in all three strains (the supplemental data are shown at http://www.nara.kindai.ac.jp/nogei/seiken/array.html), suggesting that the PhoP/PhoQ system is involved directly or indirectly in the transcription of these genes.
In gel shift and DNase I footprinting assays, all of these genes were found to be regulated directly by PhoP.
Isolation from Klebsiella and characterization of two rcs genes that activate colanic acid capsular biosynthesis in Escherichia coli.
Two genes, designated rcsA (regulation of capsule synthesis) and rcsB, that had been cloned from the chromosome of Klebsiella aerogenes (K. pneumoniae) capsular serotype K21 were capable of activating expression of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide in Escherichia coli K12.
The Klebsiella rcsA gene encoded a polypeptide of 23 kDa that was required for the induction of a mucoid phenotype at less than or equal to 30 degrees C but not at greater than or equal to 37 C.
The Klebsiella rcsB locus encoded no apparent polypeptides and was not capable by itself of causing the overproduction of colanic acid.
However, when present in the same cell with rcsA, either in cis or in trans, rcsB caused expression of mucoidy in E. coli at all growth temperatures.
These findings are best explained if the Klebsiella rcsA gene product acts as a positive regulator of colanic acid biosynthesis in E. coli and that activity of this protein is in turn subject to regulation by Lon protease.
The Klebsiella rcsB locus may exert its effect by preferentially binding a negative regulator of capsular biosynthesis, possibly Lon itself.
The ability of these rcs genes to induce a mucoid phenotype explains the apparent conjugative transfer from klebsiellae to E. coli of the ability to produce K21 or other Klebsiella capsular polysaccharides that are structurally and antigenically related to colanic acid.
Transcription regulation coupling of the divergent argG and metY promoters in Escherichia coli K-12.
The cAMP-catabolite activator protein (CAP) complex is a pleiotropic regulator that regulates a vast number of Escherichia coli genes, including those involved in carbon metabolism.
We identified two new targets of this complex: argG, which encodes the arginosuccinate synthase involved in the arginine biosynthetic pathway, and metY, which encodes one of the two methionine tRNA initiators, tRNAf2Met.
The cAMP-CAP complex activates argG transcription and inhibits metY transcription from the same DNA position.
We also show that ArgR, the specific repressor of the arginine biosynthetic pathway, together with its arginine cofactor, acts on the regulation of metY mediated by CAP.
The regulation of the two divergent promoters is thus simultaneously controlled not only by the cAMP-CAP complex, a global regulator, but also by a specific regulator of arginine metabolism, suggesting a previously unsuspected link between carbon metabolism and translation initiation.
The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex functions both as an activator and as a corepressor at the tsx-p2 promoter of Escherichia coli K-12.
The tsx-p2 promoter is one of at least seven Escherichia coli promoters that are activated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex and negatively regulated by the CytR repressor.
We show that the cAMP-CRP activator complex recognizes two sites in tsx-p2 that are separated by 33 bp: a high-affinity site (CRP-1) overlaps the -35 region, and a low-affinity site (CRP-2) is centered around position -74 bp.
The CytR repressor protects a DNA segment that is located between the two CRP sites and partially overlaps the CRP-1 target.
In combination, the cAMP-CRP and CytR proteins bind cooperatively to tsx-p2, and the nucleoprotein complex formed covers a region of 78 bp extending from the CRP-2 site close to the -10 region.
The inducer for the CytR repressor, cytidine, does not prevent in vitro DNA binding of CytR, but releases the repressor from the nucleoprotein complex and leaves the cAMP-CRP activator bound to its two DNA targets.
Thus, cytidine interferes with the cooperative DNA binding of cAMP-CRP and CytR to tsx-p2.
We characterized four tsx-p2 mutants exhibiting a reduced response to CytR; three carried mutations in the CRP-2 site, and one carried a mutation in the region between CRP-1 and the -10 sequence.
Formation of the cAMP-CRP-CytR DNA nucleoprotein complex in vitro was perturbed in each mutant.
These data indicate that the CytR repressor relies on the presence of the cAMP-CRP activator complex to regulate tsx-p2 promoter activity and that the formation of an active repression complex requires the combined interactions of cAMP-CRP and CytR at tsx-p2.
osmY (csi-5) is a representative of a large group of sigma s-dependent genes in Escherichia coli that exhibit both stationary-phase induction and osmotic regulation.
A chromosomal transcriptional lacZ fusion (csi-5::lacZ) was used to study the regulation of osmY.
We show here that in addition to sigma s, the global regulators Lrp, cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein-cAMP complex (cAMP-CRP), and integration host factor (IHF) are involved in the control of osmY.
All three regulators negatively modulate the expression of osmY, and they act independently from sigma s.
Stationary-phase induction of osmY in minimal medium can be explained by stimulation by sigma s combined with a relief of Lrp repression.
Stationary-phase induction of osmY in rich medium is mediated by the combined action of sigma s, Lrp, cAMP-CRP, and IHF, with the latter three proteins acting as transition state regulators.
The regulatory region is characterized by a sigma 70-like -10 promoter region and contains potential binding sites for Lrp, CRP, and IHF.
Whereas sigma s, Lrp, CRP, and IHF are clearly involved in stationary-phase induction, none of these regulators is essential for osmotic regulation of osmY.
Modulation of CRP-dependent transcription at the Escherichia coli acsP2 promoter by nucleoprotein complexes: anti-activation by the nucleoid proteins FIS and IHF.
acs encodes acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, a high-affinity enzyme that allows cells to scavenge for acetate during carbon starvation.
CRP activates acs transcription by binding tandem DNA sites located upstream of the major promoter, acsP2.
Here, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprint analyses to demonstrate that the nucleoid proteins FIS and IHF each bind multiple sites within the acs regulatory region, that FIS competes successfully with CRP for binding to their overlapping and neighbouring sites and that IHF binds independently of either FIS or CRP.
Using in vitro transcription assays, we demonstrated that FIS and IHF independently reduce CRP-dependent acs transcription.
Using in vivo reporter assays, we showed that disruption of DNA sites for FIS or deletion of DNA sites for IHF increases acs transcription.
We propose that FIS and IHF each function directly as anti-activators of CRP, each working independently at different times during growth to set the levels of CRP-dependent acs transcription.
Regulation of expression of the yiaKLMNOPQRS operon for carbohydrate utilization in Escherichia coli: involvement of the main transcriptional factors.
Transcription of yiaK-S as a single message from the unique promoter found upstream of yiaK is proven in this study.
Expression of the yiaK-S operon is controlled in the wild-type strain by a repressor encoded by yiaJ.
No inducer molecule of the yiaK-S operon has been identified among over 80 carbohydrate or derivative compounds tested, the system being expressed only in a mutant strain lacking the YiaJ repressor.
The lacZ transcriptional fusions in the genetic background of the mutant strain revealed that yiaK-S is modulated by the integration host factor and by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (Crp) activator complex.
A twofold increase in the induction was observed during anaerobic growth, which was independent of ArcA or Fnr.
Gel mobility shift assays showed that the YiaJ repressor binds to a promoter fragment extending from -50 to +121.
These studies also showed that the cAMP-Crp complex can bind to two different sites.
The lacZ transcriptional fusions of different fragments of the promoter demonstrated that binding of cAMP-Crp to the Crp site 1, centered at -106, is essential for yiaK-S expression.
Expression of yiaJ is autogenously regulated and reduced by the binding of Crp-cAMP to the Crp site 1 of the yiaK-S promoter.
Molecular analysis of the regulation of csiD, a carbon starvation-inducible gene in Escherichia coli that is exclusively dependent on sigma s and requires activation by cAMP-CRP.
In contrast to sigma s, which is induced in response to many different stresses, csiD, whose expression is driven from a single promoter, is induced by carbon starvation only.
To our knowledge, the csiD promoter is the first characterized promoter which is not only exclusively dependent on sigma s-containing RNA polymerase (E sigma s), but also requires an activator, cAMP-CRP.
In addition, leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) acts as a positive modulator of csiD expression.
With linear templates, cAMP-CRP significantly stimulates E sigma s-mediated in vitro transcription, whereas transcription by E sigma 70 is negligible and hardly stimulated by cAMP-CRP.
In vitro transcription experiments with super-coiled templates, however, revealed significant cAMP-CRP-stimulated transcription also by E sigma 70.
Yet, under these conditions, H-NS was found to restore E sigma s specificity by strongly interfering with cAMP-CRP/E sigma 70-dependent transcription.
Lrp strongly and cooperatively binds to multiple sites located between positions -14 and -102 (in a way that suggests DNA wrapping around multiple Lrp molecules) and moderately stimulates in vitro transcription, especially with E sigma s.
Gene expression regulation by the Curli activator CsgD protein: modulation of cellulose biosynthesis and control of negative determinants for microbial adhesion.
Curli fibers, encoded by the csgBAC genes, promote biofilm formation in Escherichia coli and other enterobacteria.
Curli production is dependent on the CsgD transcription activator, which also promotes cellulose biosynthesis.
In this study, we investigated the effects of CsgD expression from a weak constitutive promoter in the biofilm formation-deficient PHL565 strain of E. coli.
Constitutive CsgD expression promotes biofilm formation by PHL565 and activates transcription from the csgBAC promoter; however, csgBAC expression remains dependent on temperature and the growth medium.
Constitutive expression of the CsgD protein results in altered transcription patterns for at least 24 novel genes, in addition to the previously identified CsgD-dependent genes.
The cspA and fecR genes, encoding regulatory proteins responding to cold shock and to iron, respectively, and yoaD, encoding a putative negative regulator of cellulose biosynthesis, were found to be some of the novel CsgD-regulated genes.
Consistent with the predicted functional role, increased expression of the yoaD gene negatively affects cell aggregation, while yoaD inactivation results in stimulation of cell aggregation and leads to increased cellulose production.
Inactivation of fecR results in significant increases in both cell aggregation and biofilm formation, while the effects of cspA are not as strong in the conditions tested.
Our results indicate that CsgD can modulate cellulose biosynthesis through activation of the yoaD gene.
In addition, the positive effect of CsgD on biofilm formation might be enhanced by repression of the fecR gene.
Methylation of two GATC sites (GATC1028 and GATC1130) within the pap regulatory region is differentially inhibited in phase ON and phase OFF cells.
DNA footprint analysis using non-methylated pap DNAs indicates that Lrp binds to a region surrounding the GATC1130 site, whereas PapI does not appear to bind to pap regulatory DNA.
Moreover, Dam methylation inhibits binding of Lrp/PapI near the GATC1028 site and alters binding of Lrp at the GATC1130 site.
To this end, we have employed DNA microarray technology to identify genes involved in the regulatory networks that facilitate the transition of Escherichia coli cells from an aerobic to an anaerobic growth state.
We also report the identification of a subset of these genes that are regulated by a global regulatory protein for anaerobic metabolism, FNR.
Analysis of these data demonstrated that the expression of over one-third of the genes expressed during growth under aerobic conditions are altered when E. coli cells transition to an anaerobic growth state, and that the expression of 712 (49%) of these genes are either directly or indirectly modulated by FNR.
The results presented here also suggest interactions between the FNR and the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) regulatory networks.
Expression of ptsG encoding the major glucose transporter is regulated by ArcA in Escherichia coli.
Thus far, the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex and Mlc are known to be the major regulators of ptsHIcrr and ptsG expression in response to the availability of carbon sources.
In this report, we performed ligand fishing experiments by using the promoters of ptsHIcrr and ptsG as bait to find out new factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system in Escherichia coli, and we found that the anaerobic regulator ArcA specifically binds to the promoters.
Deletion of the arcA gene caused about a 2-fold increase in the ptsG expression, and overexpression of ArcA significantly decreased glucose consumption.
In vitro transcription assays showed that phospho-ArcA (ArcA-P) represses ptsG P1 transcription.
DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that ArcA-P binds to three sites upstream of the ptsG P1 promoter, two of which overlap the CRP-binding sites, and the ArcA-P binding decreases the CRP binding that is essential for the ptsG P1 transcription.
These results suggest that the response regulator ArcA regulates expression of enzyme IICB(Glc) mediating the first step of glucose metabolism in response to the redox conditions of growth in E. coli.
Regulation of the Escherichia coli K-12 uvrB operon.
The UV light inducibility of the uvrB operon of Escherichia coli K-12 was previously demonstrated by exploiting a strain in which the gene for the enzyme beta-galactosidase was inserted into the uvrB operon.
Analyses to quantitate the induction of this system show that derepression of the operon is first detectable 5 min after UV exposure, with the rate of synthesis increasing to four to six times the uninduced rate during the subsequent 30 min.
The control of uvrB was found to result from direct repression by the lexA gene product, with the recA gene product playing an indirect role.
CpxR/OmpR interplay regulates curli gene expression in response to osmolarity in Escherichia coli.
OmpR was shown to activate csgD expression, resulting in curli production.
The CpxR regulator was shown to negatively affect curli gene expression when binding to its recognition site that overlaps the csgD OmpR-binding site.
This study was undertaken to clarify how the interplay between the two regulatory proteins, OmpR and CpxR, can affect the transcription of the curli gene in response to variation of the medium osmolarity.
Band-shift assays with purified CpxR proteins indicate that CpxR binds to the csgD promoter region at multiple sites that are ideally positioned to explain the csg repression activity of CpxR.
We establish here that the Cpx pathway is activated at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels in response to a high osmolarity medium and that CpxR represses csgD expression in high-salt-content medium, resulting in low curli production.
However, csgD repression in response to high sucrose content is not mediated by CpxR but by the global regulatory protein H-NS.
Therefore, multiple systems (EnvZ/OmpR, Cpx, Rcs, and H-NS) appear to be involved in sensing environmental osmolarity, leading to sophisticated regulation of the curli genes.
In Escherichia coli, the ferric uptake regulator (Fur) controls expression of the iron regulon in response to iron availability while the cyclic AMP receptor protein (Crp) regulates expression of the carbon regulon in response to carbon availability.
Many iron transport genes and several carbon metabolic genes are subject to dual control, being repressed by the loss of Crp and activated by the loss of Fur.
However, the sodB gene, encoding superoxide dismutase, and the aceBAK operon, encoding the glyoxalate shunt enzymes, show the opposite responses, being activated by the loss of Crp and repressed by the loss of Fur.
Several other genes including the sdhA-D, sucA-D, and fumA genes, encoding key constituents of the Krebs cycle, proved to be repressed by the loss of both transcription factors.
Finally, the loss of both Crp and Fur activated a heterogeneous group of genes under sigmaS control encoding, for example, the cyclopropane fatty acid synthase, Cfa, the glycogen synthesis protein, GlgS, the 30S ribosomal protein, S22, and the mechanosensitive channel protein, YggB.
Many genes appeared to be regulated by the two transcription factors in an apparently additive fashion, but apparent positive or negative cooperativity characterized several putative Crp/Fur interactions.
Gel shift assays and DNase I protection assays verified that both sites bind MetR.
Homocysteine, a coregulator for MetR, increased MetR binding to the glyA control region.
Although the DNA did not show any significant intrinsic bend, MetR binding resulted in a bending angle of about 33 degrees.
To verify that the MetR binding sites play a functional role in glyA expression, site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter the two binding sites in a lambda glyA-lacZ gene fusion phage.
Changing the binding sites toward the consensus MetR binding sequence caused an increase in glyA-lacZ expression.
Changing either binding site away from the consensus sequence caused a decrease in expression, suggesting that both sites are required for normal glyA regulation.
DNA binding sites for the Mlc and NagC proteins: regulation of nagE, encoding the N-acetylglucosamine-specific transporter in Escherichia coli.
The NagC and Mlc proteins are homologous transcriptional regulators that control the expression of several phosphotransferase system (PTS) genes in Escherichia coli.
NagC represses nagE, encoding the N:-acetylglucosamine-specific transporter, while Mlc represses three PTS operons, ptsG, manXYZ and ptsHIcrr, involved in the uptake of glucose.
NagC and Mlc can bind to each others operator, at least in vitro.
The nagE operator does exhibit a higher affinity for Mlc than NagC, but no regulation of nagE by physiological concentrations of Mlc was detected in vivo.
Regulation of wild-type nagE by NagC is achieved because of the chelation effect due to a second high affinity NagC operator covering the nagB promoter.
Replacing the A/T at +11/-11 with C/G allows repression by NagC in the absence of the nagB operator.
Regulation of microcin C51 operon expression: the role of global regulators of transcription.
Expression of the microcin C51 operon in Escherichia coli cells is regulated as a function of the phase of growth; it is stimulated during the decelerating phase of growth.
Using single-copy P(mcc)-lac transcriptional fusion (the promoter region of the microcin C51 operon fused to a promoterless lac operon in lambda phage), we showed that transcription from the microcin operon promoter is dependent on sigma(s) (RpoS) factor.
However, some level of P(mcc)-lac expression is possible in rpoS null mutants, indicating that another sigma factor might be involved in transcription of the microcin C51 operon.
Overproduction of sigma70 decreased Pmcc-directed transcription, presumably as a result of competition of sigma factors for the limited amount of core RNA polymerase.
The cyclic AMP-CRP complex was shown to stimulate transcription from Pmcc: the absence of CRP or cAMP in crp or cya mutant cells strongly decreased the level of P(mcc)-lac expression.
The production of C51 microcin decreased or was absent in rpoS, crp and cya mutant cells.
Leucine-responsive protein Lrp and histone-like protein H-NS repressed P(mcc)-lac expression in the exponential and decelerating phases of growth.
In studies of P(mcc)-lac expression in double mutant cells, we showed that proteins CRP, Lrp and H-NS acted in rpoS-dependent and rpoS-independent ways in transcription of the microcin C51 operon.
Mutation hns(-) resulted in an increase in P(mcc)-lac expression in crp, rpoS and lrp mutant cells, as in wild-type cells.
Nucleotide sequence and characterization of the sfs1 gene: sfs1 is involved in CRP*-dependent mal gene expression in Escherichia coli.
The nucleotide sequence of sfs1 encoded a protein of 234 amino acids (molecular mass, 26,227 Da) which also has a putative DNA binding domain.
Overexpression of the sfs1 gene in MK2001 resulted in a 10-fold increase of amylomaltase, which was still dependent on MalT.
Escherichia coli leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) controls lysyl-tRNA synthetase expression.
Using random Tn10 insertion mutagenesis, we isolated an Escherichia coli mutant strain affected in the regulation of lysU, the gene encoding the inducible form of lysyl-tRNA synthetase.
The transposon giving rise to the altered expression of lysU was found inserted within lrp.
The latter gene codes for the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) which mediates a global response of the bacterium to leucine.
An involvement of Lrp in the regulation of lysU was searched for by using a lysU-lacZ operon fusion.
inactivation of lrp causes an increased activity of the lysU promoter, whatever the growth conditions assayed, (ii) insertion of a wild-type lrp gene into a multi-copy plasmid significantly reduces lysU expression, and (iii) sensitivity of the lysU promoter to the presence of leucine in the growth medium is abolished in the lrp context.
In vitro DNase I protection experiments indicated that among operators of the gal regulon, GalS binds most strongly to the external operator of the mgl operon, which encodes the high-affinity beta-methylgalactoside galactose transport system, and with less affinity to the operators controlling expression of the gal operon, which codes for enzymes of galactose metabolism.
GalS has even less affinity for the external operator of galP, which codes for galactose permease, the major low-affinity galactose transporter in the cell.
This order of affinities is the reverse of that of GalR, which binds most strongly to the operator of galP and most weakly to that of mgl.
Our results also show that GalS, like its homolog, GalR, is a dimeric protein which in binding to the bipartite operators of the gal operon selectively represses its P1 promoter.
Consistent with the fact that GalR is the exclusive regulator of the low-affinity galactose transporter, galactose permease, and that the major role of GalS is in regulating expression of the high-affinity galactose transporter encoded by the mgl operon, we found that the DNA binding of GalS is 15-fold more sensitive than that of GalR to galactose.
Integration host factor binds specifically to multiple sites in the ompB promoter of Escherichia coli and inhibits transcription.
Escherichia coli integration host factor (IHF) is a DNA-binding protein that participates in gene regulation, site-specific recombination, and other processes in E. coli and some of its bacteriophages and plasmids.
Gel retardation experiments and DNase I footprinting studies revealed that IHF binds to three sites in the ompB promoter region.
In vitro transcription from ompB promoter fragments was specifically blocked by IHF.
In vivo experiments showed that IHF is a negative effector of ompB expression in growing cells.
Analysis of IHF binding site mutations strongly suggested that IHF binding in the ompB promoter region is necessary for the negative effects seen in vivo.
We have studied in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli the properties of pseudo-HPr suppressor mutations.
These mutations suppressed the defects in a ptsH mutant which lacks HPr, one of the enzymes of the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system.
The suppressor mutation was mapped in S. typhimurium at 3 min, closely linked to leu.
Pseudo-HPr suppressor mutations (fruR) and a deletion extending clockwise from leu resulted in the constitutive expression of the fru operon containing the genes for IIFru (fruA), IIIFru (fruB), fructose 1-phosphate kinase (fruK) and pseudo-HPr (fruF).
fruR probably codes for a repressor of the fru operon.
IIIFru could be phosphorylated both via HPr and pseudo-HPr, since mutants lacking pseudo-HPr activity were still able to phosphorylate fructose in the presence of added HPr.
Both the pseudo-HPr suppressor mutations at 3 min and the deletion extending from leu had an additional phenotype.
Introduction of these mutations or deletions was always accompanied by disappearance of PEP synthase activity.
Complementation of such a mutant with the cloned fragments reversed both phenotypes at the same time.
Possibly, the fruR gene product acts as an activator of the gene coding for PEP synthase.
Lrp binds to two regions in the dadAX promoter region of Escherichia coli to repress and activate transcription directly.
The dadAX operon is expressed by multiple promoters that are repressed by leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) and activated by cyclic AMP-CRP.
In previous work, we found that alanine or leucine acted as inducers to antagonize Lrp repression of the three major promoters directly.
A mutational analysis, coupled with in vivo and in vitro transcription experiments, indicated that Lrp sites that overlap the dad promoters were involved in repression.
In contrast, sites upstream of the promoters did not appear to be necessary for repression, but were required for activation by Lrp plus alanine or leucine of one of the major dad promoters, P2.
This activation by alanine or leucine was not simply relief of repression, as P2 transcription from a constitutive template was increased fivefold compared with the basal level of transcription found in the absence of Lrp and the co-activator cyclic AMP-CRP.
Alanine or leucine decreased the affinity of Lrp to repressor sites, while having little or no effect on the binding of Lrp to activator sites.
This differential effect of alanine and leucine on Lrp binding helps to explain how these modifiers influence both repression and activation of the dad operon.
Regulation in the rpoS regulon of Escherichia coli.
In Escherichia coli, the transcription factor sigma s, encoded by rpoS, controls the expression of a large number of genes involved in cellular responses to a diverse number of stresses, including starvation, osmotic stress, acid shock, cold shock, heat shock, oxidative DNA damage, and transition to stationary phase.
The transcription factor sigma s acts predominantly as a positive effector, but it does have a negative effect on some genes.
The synthesis and accumulation of sigma s are controlled by mechanisms affecting transcription, translation, proteolysis, and the formation of the holoenzyme complex.
Transcriptional control of rpoS involves guanosine 3',5'-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) and polyphosphate as positive regulators and the cAMP receptor protein-cAMP complex (CRP-cAMP) as a negative regulator.
Translation of rpoS mRNA is controlled by a cascade of interacting factors, including Hfq, H-NS, dsrA RNA, LeuO, and oxyS RNA that seem to modulate the stability of a region of secondary structure in the ribosome-binding region of the gene's mRNA.
The transcription factor sigma s is sensitive to proteolysis by ClpPX in a reaction that is promoted by RssB and inhibited by the chaperone DnaK.
The activity of sigma s may also be modulated by trehalose and glutamate, which activate holoenzyme formation and promote holoenzyme binding to certain promoters.
The leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) acts as a specific repressor for sigma s-dependent transcription of the Escherichia coli aidB gene.
The aidB gene is not expressed constitutively, but its transcription is induced via distinct mechanisms in response to: (i) exposure to alkylating agents; (ii) acetate at a slightly acidic pH; and (iii) anoxia.
Induction by alkylating agents is mediated by the transcriptional activator Ada, in its methylated form (meAda); the other forms of induction are Ada independent and require sigma s, the alternative sigma factor mainly expressed during the stationary phase of bacterial growth.
In this report we show that, in the absence of any transcriptional factor, aidB is efficiently transcribed in vitro by the sigma s, but not by the sigma 70, form of RNA polymerase holoenzyme.
In the presence of meAda, levels of transcription by both forms of RNA polymerase are significantly increased.
However, sigma s-dependent transcription of aidB is inhibited both in vitro and in vivo by binding of the transcriptional regulator Lrp (leucine responsive protein) to the aidB promoter region (PaidB).
Lrp acts as a specific repressor for sigma s-dependent transcription of aidB.
Leucine counteracts Lrp binding to P aidB, as does binding to P aidB of me Ada, which causes Lrp to dissociate from the promoter.
NO sensing by FNR: regulation of the Escherichia coli NO-detoxifying flavohaemoglobin, Hmp.
Because hmp gene transcription is repressed by the O(2)-responsive regulator FNR, we investigated whether FNR also senses NO.
The [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster of FNR is oxygen labile and controls protein dimerization and site-specific DNA binding.
NO reacts anaerobically with the Fe-S cluster of purified FNR, generating spectral changes consistent with formation of a dinitrosyl-iron-cysteine complex.
FNR binds at an FNR box within the hmp promoter (P(hmp)).
FNR samples inactivated by either O(2) or NO bind specifically to P(hmp), but with lower affinity.
Dose-dependent up-regulation of P(hmp) in vivo by NO concentrations of pathophysiological relevance is abolished by fnr mutation, and NO also modulates expression from model FNR-regulated promoters.
Thus, FNR can respond to not only O(2), but also NO, with major implications for global gene regulation in bacteria.
We propose an NO-mediated mechanism of hmp regulation by which E.coli responds to NO challenge.
The regulation of the Escherichia coli mazEF promoter involves an unusual alternating palindrome.
Upstream from the mazEF module are two promoters, P(2) and P(3) that are strongly negatively autoregulated by MazE and MazF.
We show that the expression of this module is positively regulated by the factor for inversion stimulation.
What seems to be responsible for the negative autoregulation of mazEF is an unusual DNA structure, which we have called an "alternating palindrome." The middle part, "a," of this structure may complement either the downstream fragment, "b," or the upstream fragment, "c"
When the MazE.MazF complex binds either of these arms of the alternating palindrome, strong negative autoregulation results.
We suggest that the combined presence of the two promoters, the alternating palindrome structure and the factor for inversion stimulation-binding site, all permit the expression of the mazEF module to be sensitively regulated under various growth conditions.
Transcriptional regulation of the aconitase genes (acnA and acnB) of Escherichia coli.
Escherichia coli contains two differentially regulated aconitase genes, acnA and acnB.
Two acnA promoters transcribing from start points located 407 bp (P1acnA) and 50 bp (P2acnA) upstream of the acnA coding region, and one acnB promoter (PacnB) with a start point 95 bp upstream of the acnB coding region, were identified by primer extension analysis.
These findings are consistent with previous observations that acnA is specifically subject to SoxRS-mediated activation, whereas acnB encodes the major aconitase that is synthesized earlier in the growth cycle than AcnA.
Further studies with acn-lacZ gene fusions and a wider range of transcription regulators indicated that acnA expression is initiated by sigma 38 from P1acnA, and from P2acnA it is activated directly or indirectly by CRP, FruR, Fur and SoxRS, and repressed by ArcA and FNR.
In contrast, acnB expression is activated by CRP and repressed by ArcA, FruR and Fis from PacnB.
Comparable studies with fum-lacZ fusions indicated that transcription of fumC, but not of fumA or fumB, is initiated by RNA polymerase containing sigma 38.
Structure and regulation of the glpFK operon encoding glycerol diffusion facilitator and glycerol kinase of Escherichia coli K-12.
The glpF gene encodes a cytoplasmic membrane protein which facilitates the diffusion of glycerol into the cell.
The glpK gene encodes glycerol kinase.
Binding sites for the cAMP-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex and the glp repressor were identified by DNase I footprinting.
The region protected by the cAMP.CRP complex contained tandem sequences resembling the consensus sequence for CRP binding.
The CRP sites were centered at 37.5 and 60.5 base pairs upstream of the start of transcription.
The glp repressor protected an extensive area (-89 to -7 relative to the start point of transcription), sufficient for the binding of four repressor tetramers.
Two additional binding sites for the repressor were identified within the glpK coding region.
The DNA containing these two operators synergistically increased the apparent affinity of glp repressor for DNA fragments containing the four operators in the promoter region of the glpFK operon.
The degree of catabolite repression for each of the operons was assessed using a similar system.
In this case, the relative sensitivity of the glp operons to catabolite repression was glpTQ greater than glpFK greater than glpACB greater than glpD.
Escherichia coli gene expression responsive to levels of the response regulator EvgA.
EvgA overexpression conferred acid resistance to exponentially growing cells.
This acid resistance was abolished by deletion of ydeP, ydeO, or yhiE, which was induced by EvgA overexpression.
These results suggest that ydeP, ydeO, and yhiE are novel genes related to acid resistance and that EvgA regulates several acid resistance genes.
Furthermore, the deletion of yhiE completely abolished acid resistance in stationary-phase cells, suggesting that YhiE plays a critical role in stationary-phase acid resistance.
The multidrug resistance in an acrB deletion mutant caused by EvgA overexpression was completely abolished by deletion of yhiUV, while the emrKY deletion had no effect on the increase in resistance by EvgA overexpression.
In addition, EvgA overexpression did not confer resistance in a tolC-deficient strain.
These results suggest that YhiUV induced by EvgA overexpression is functionally associated with TolC and contributes to multidrug resistance.
Novel MetJ binding sites are found upstream of the metK gene, as well as upstream of a gene, abc, a gene that encodes for a component of a multifunction transporter which may transport amino acids across the membrane.
The Escherichia coli flhD operon encodes two genes, flhD and flhC.
Mobility shift assays showed that the FlhD/FlhC complex had a DNA-binding activity and bound to the upstream regions of fliA, flhB, and fliL operons (class II), which are under direct control of the flhD operon.
DNase I footprinting analyses of FlhD/FlhC binding to the three class II promoter regions revealed protection of a 48-bp region of the fliA operon between positions -41 to -88, a 50-bp region of the flhB operon between positions -28 to -77, and a 48-bp region of the fliL operon between positions -29 to -76.
In vitro transcription experiments demonstrated that the FlhD/FlhC complex is a transcriptional activator required for the transcription of the three class II operons examined in vitro.
Transcriptional regulation and organization of the dcuA and dcuB genes, encoding homologous anaerobic C4-dicarboxylate transporters in Escherichia coli.
The dcuA and dcuB genes of Escherichia coli encode homologous proteins that appear to function as independent and mutually redundant C4-dicarboxylate transporters during anaerobiosis.
To learn more about the respective roles of the dcu genes, the environmental and regulatory factors influencing their expression were investigated by generating and analyzing single-copy dcuA- and dcuB-lacZ transcriptional fusions.
The results show that dcuA is constitutively expressed whereas dcuB expression is highly regulated.
The dcuB gene is strongly activated anaerobically by FNR, repressed in the presence of nitrate by NarL, and subject to cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP)-mediated catabolite repression.
In addition, dcuB is strongly induced by C4-dicarboxylates, suggesting that dcuB is under the control of an uncharacterized C4-dicarboxylate-responsive gene regulator.
Northern blotting confirmed that dcuA (and aspA) is expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions and that dcuB (and fumB) is induced anaerobically.
Major monocistronic transcripts were identified for aspA and dcuA, as well as a minor species possibly corresponding to an aspA-dcuA cotranscript.
Five major transcripts were observed for dcuB and fumB: monocistronic transcripts for both fumB and dcuB; a dcuB-fumB cotranscript; and two transcripts, possibly corresponding to dcuB-fumB and fumB mRNA degradation products.
The expression of dcuB is entirely consistent with a primary role for DcuB in mediating C4-dicarboxylate transport during anaerobic fumarate respiration.
Previous studies with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 demonstrated that transcriptional activation of the prpBCDE operon requires the function of transcription factor PrpR, sigma-54, and IHF.
In this study, we found that transcription from the prpBCDE and prpR promoters was down-regulated by the addition of glucose or glycerol, indicating that these genes may be regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex.
Furthermore, cells with defects in cya or crp exhibited reduced transcriptional activation of prpR and prpBCDE in Escherichia coli.
These results demonstrate that propionate metabolism is subject to catabolite repression by the global transcriptional regulator CRP and that this regulation is effected through control of both the regulator gene prpR and the prpBCDE operon itself.
The clyA gene encodes a novel haemolysin that is not expressed by wild-type E. coli under tested laboratory conditions.
Western and Northern blot analyses, and DNA-band-shift assays support a model whereby the SlyA(EC) protein activates clyA expression by binding to the clyA promoter region, thereby supporting the sequence similarity data in suggesting that SlyA(ST) is a haemolysin activator rather than being a haemolysin per se.
Cooperative interaction between Cra and Fnr in the regulation of the cydAB operon of Escherichia coli.
In vivo and in vitro experiments are reported demonstrating that the catabolite repressor-activator (Cra) protein (formerly designated FruR) regulates expression of the cydAB operon of Escherichia coli encoding cytochrome d oxidase.
The Fnr protein is required for Cra-mediated transcriptional control, but the ArcA protein antagonizes the response to Cra.
The results establish that Fnr, ArcA, and Cra exert their effects in an interdependent fashion.
Examination of expression of transcriptional fusions allowed us to demonstrate autoregulation of both genes by IHF.
Negative regulation of DNA repair gene (uvrA) expression by ArcA/ArcB two-component system in Escherichia coli.
The ArcA/ArcB two-component signal transduction system of Escherichia coli regulates gene expression in response to the redox conditions of growth.
In this study, uvrA gene expression was repressed when ArcA was induced in E. coli.
Transcription of uvrA increased in DeltaarcA and DeltaarcB strains more than in the wild-type strain, whose trend was remarkable under the anaerobic condition.
In the wild-type strain grown in the presence of DTT (10 mM), the uvrA gene expression was also repressed.
Furthermore, the results of in vitro transcription and DNase I footprinting experiments indicated that ArcA specifically bound to the ArcA box [(A/T)GTTAATTA(A/T)] in the uvrA promoter and represses its transcription.
These results suggest that the ArcA/ArcB two-component system works to negatively regulate uvrA gene expression.
Thus this effect of iron was also seen in a sodA::lacZ operon fusion in which the production of beta-galactosidase was regulated by the sodA promoter.
It thus appears that the effectiveness of specific metal cations to act as corepressors with Fur varies with the gene being regulated by the Fur-metal complex.
In vitro interactions of integration host factor with the ompF promoter-regulatory region of Escherichia coli.
Previous work has shown that integration host factor (IHF) mutants have increased expression and altered osmoregulation of OmpF, a major Escherichia coli outer membrane protein.
By in vitro analysis the possibility was investigated that IHF interacts directly with the ompF promoter region.
Gel retardation assays and DNase I protection experiments showed that IHF binds to two sites in the ompF promoter region centered at positions -180 and -60 relative to the start of transcription.
Gel electrophoresis studies with circularly permuted ompF promoter fragments indicated that IHF binding strongly increased a small intrinsic bend in the ompF promoter region.
The addition of IHF to a purified in vitro transcription system strongly and specifically inhibited ompF transcription.
This inhibition was reversed by increasing the concentration of OmpR, a positive activator required for ompF expression, suggesting that IHF may inhibit ompF transcription by altering how OmpR interacts with the ompF promoter.
The Escherichia coli yjhA (renamed nanC) gene encodes a protein of the KdgM family of outer membrane-specific channels.
It is transcribed divergently from fimB, a gene involved in the site-specific inversion of the region controlling transcription of the fimbrial structural genes but is separated from it by one of the largest intergenic regions in E. coli.
We show that nanC expression is induced by N-acetylneuraminic acid and modulated by N-acetylglucosamine.
This regulation occurs via the NanR and NagC regulators, which also control fimB expression.
nanC expression is also activated by the regulators cyclic AMP-catabolite activator protein, OmpR, and CpxR.
Regulation of HU alpha and HU beta by CRP and FIS in Escherichia coli.
The dimeric histone-like protein HU, one of the most abundant DNA binding proteins of Escherichia coli, is encoded by two closely related but unlinked genes, hupA and hupB.
Overproduction of one or the other of the subunits has been shown to induce the SOS response and mucoidy.
To understand how the synthesis of this protein is coordinated, we studied the transcription control of the two hup genes.
We show here that CRP stimulated the transcription of both genes.
In contrast, the FIS protein, one of the major positive regulators of the stable RNA operons, stimulated the transcription of the hupA gene, whereas it repressed that of the hupB gene.
Moreover, stringent control, which like FIS also regulates the transcription of the stable RNA operons, affected the hupB transcription while it had no effect on hupA.
This opposite regulation of the transcription of the two HU genes is reflected at the protein level signifying that changes in the composition of HU occur upon changes in the environment.
It is rather unexpected that such divergent transcriptional regulation controls the two genes encoding a dimeric protein.
H-NS protein represses transcription of the lux systems of Vibrio fischeri and other luminous bacteria cloned into Escherichia coli.
Mutation of the hns gene in E. coli has resulted in strong expression of the V. fischeri lux system at low cell density even in an rpoS-deleted strain of E. coli that emits very low levels of luminescence.
Taken together, these data suggest that the H-NS protein inhibits transcription in E. coli of the lux systems of all or most luminous bacteria at the luxC gene as well as in the luxRI region of the V. fischeri lux operon.
The Escherichia coli melAB promoter is co-dependent upon two transcription activators, MelR and the cyclic AMP receptor protein, CRP.
In this study we demonstrate positive co-operativity between the binding of MelR and CRP at the melAB promoter, which provides a simple mechanism for its co-dependence.
MelR binds to four sites, centred at positions -42.5, -62.5, -100.5 and -120.5 relative to the melAB transcription start point.
When MelR is pre-bound, CRP is able to bind to a target located between MelR at positions -62.5 and -100.5.
This increases the occupation of the two downstream sites for MelR, which is essential for transcription.
Thus, MelR and CRP activate transcription by a novel mechanism in which they bind co-operatively to adjacent sites and form a bacterial enhanceosome.
The global regulatory protein FruR modulates the direction of carbon flow in Escherichia coli.
The Escherichia coli fructose repressor, FruR, is known to regulate expression of several genes concerned with carbon utilization.
Using a previously derived consensus sequence for FruR binding, additional potential operators were identified and tested for FruR binding in DNA band migration retardation assays.
Operators in the control regions of operons concerned with carbon metabolism bound FruR, while those in operons not concerned with carbon metabolism did not.
In vivo assays with transcriptional lacZ fusions showed that FruR controls the expression of FruR operator-containing genes encoding key enzymes of virtually every major pathway of carbon metabolism.
Moreover, a fruR null mutation altered the rates of utilization of at least 36 carbon sources.
Alignment of FruR operators revealed that the consensus sequence for FruR binding is the same for operons that are activated and repressed by FruR and permitted formulation of a revised FruR-binding consensus sequence.
The reported observations indicate that FruR modulates the direction of carbon flow by transcriptional activation of genes encoding enzymes concerned with oxidative and gluconeogenic carbon flow and by repression of those concerned with fermentative carbon flow.
A distant upstream site involved in the negative regulation of the Escherichia coli ompF gene.
OmpR is a DNA-binding protein which acts as both an activator and a repressor to control ompF transcription.
Inactivation of this site by insertion of a 22-bp fragment prevents the repression of ompF expression conferred by the dominant negative mutation, envZ473.
Mizuno, Gene 54:57-64, 1987), and the fact that mutations altering integration host factor result in constitutive ompF expression (P. Tsui, V. Helu, and M. Freundlich, J. Bacteriol. 170:4950-4953, 1988), we propose that the negative regulation of ompF involves a DNA loop structure.
Regulation of lrp gene expression by H-NS and Lrp proteins in Escherichia coli: dominant negative mutations in lrp.
Lrp (leucine-responsive regulatory protein) is a global transcription factor of Escherichia coli and regulates, negatively or positively, many genes including lysU, which encodes lysyl-tRNA synthetase.
Dominant negative mutations that derepress lysU expression were isolated in this study.
These mutations affected a predicted DNA-binding domain of Lrp and mutants were defective DNA-binding domain of Lrp and mutants were defective both in activation of ilvIH expression and in repression of lysU expression.
Consistent with the previous notion that lrp is autoregulated, lrp expression was derepressed by these mutations and repressed by multi-copy plasmids carrying lrp+.
Moreover, we found by gene fusion and Northern blot hybridization that the "histone-like" protein, H-NS, bound specifically to a promoter segment of lrp in vitro, and the level of lrp expression increased in the hns null mutant.
These results indicated that the lrp gene is not only feedback regulated by Lrp but is also controlled by H-NS protein.
Dual overlapping promoters control napF (periplasmic nitrate reductase) operon expression in Escherichia coli K-12.
Periplasmic nitrate reductase, encoded by the napFDAGHBC operon, functions with concentrations of nitrate that are too low to support respiration by membrane-bound nitrate reductase.
The napF operon control region exhibits unusual organization of DNA binding sites for the transcription regulators Fnr and NarP, which activate transcription in response to anaerobiosis and nitrate, respectively.
Previous studies have shown that the napF operon control region directs synthesis of two transcripts whose 5' ends differ by about 3 nucleotides.
Results indicate that the downstream promoter (P1) was responsible for Fnr- and NarP-regulated napF operon expression, whereas transcription from the upstream promoter (P2) was activated only weakly by the Fnr protein and was inhibited by phospho-NarP and -NarL proteins.
These results establish the unconventional napF operon control region architecture, in which the major promoter P1 is activated by the Fnr protein bound to a site centered at -64.5 with respect to the transcription initiation site, working in conjunction with the phospho-NarP protein bound to a site centered at -44.5.
Positive and negative transcriptional regulation of the Escherichia coli gluconate regulon gene gntT by GntR and the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein complex.
The gntT gene of Escherichia coli is specifically induced by gluconate and repressed via catabolite repression.
Thus, gluconate is both an inducer and a repressor of gntT expression since gluconate is a catabolite-repressing sugar.
In a gntR deletion mutant, the expression of a chromosomal gntT::lacZ fusion is both high and constitutive, confirming that GntR is the negative regulator of gntT.
Indeed, GntR binds to two consensus gnt operator sites; one overlaps the -10 region of the gntT promoter, and the other is centered at +120 with respect to the transcriptional start site.
The binding of GntR to these sites was proven in vitro by gel redardation assays and in vivo by site-directed mutagenesis of the binding sites.
Binding of GntR to the operators is eliminated by gluconate and also by 6-phosphogluconate at a 10-fold-higher concentration.
Interestingly, when gntR deletion strains are grown in the presence of gluconate, there is a twofold decrease in gntT expression which is independent of catabolite repression and binding of GntR to the operator sites.
Transcription of gntT is activated by binding of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex to a CRP binding site positioned at -71 upstream of the gntT transcription start site.
Oxygen regulation of the Escherichia coli cytochrome d oxidase (cydAB) operon: roles of multiple promoters and the Fnr-1 and Fnr-2 binding sites.
The Escherichia coli cydAB operon encodes the high-affinity terminal oxidase of the oxygen respiratory chain, cytochrome d oxidase.
The sensor-regulator pair, ArcB-ArcA, is responsible for the microaerobic activation of the cydAB operon, whereas the anaerobic regulator Fnr represses its expression in the absence of oxygen.
Fnr binds in vitro at two sites within the cydAB promoter element.
To discern whether these two regions have an in vivo function in the anaerobic regulation of cydAB, the Fnr-binding motifs were mutagenized individually and in combination.
The effects of these mutations on in vivo gene expression were determined by lac fusion and primer extension analysis.
Our results show that the Fnr-2 site is critical for Fnr-mediated anaerobic repression of the two main cydAB promoters, P1 and P2.
In contrast, the Fnr-1 site has an auxiliary role in the anaerobic repression of P1, but not of P2.
Transcription from P1 did not affect ArcA-mediated activation or Fnr-mediated repression of P2, indicating that oxygen regulation is exerted on both promoters in an independent fashion.
Two of these promoters, designated P3 and P4, are co-ordinately regulated with P1 and P2 in response to oxygen, ArcA and Fnr.
The P5 promoter is not Fnr regulated and is only weakly activated by ArcA.
The contribution of these three additional promoters to the overall cydAB expression is most relevant under aerobic conditions.
Our results suggest a unique repression model, in which one Fnr dimer bound to one single site (Fnr-2) is sufficient to downregulate transcription from four cydAB promoters.
In conclusion, transcription of the cydAB operon is driven by a complex regulatory element containing at least five promoters that act in unison to provide adequate oxygen control of gene expression.
The Escherichia coli cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) is a global regulator that controls transcription initiation from more than 100 promoters by binding to a specific DNA sequence within cognate promoters.
Using ROMA, we identified 176 operons that were activated by CRP in vitro and 16 operons that were repressed.
Sequence analysis of the operons that were repressed by CRP revealed different mechanisms for CRP inhibition.
In contrast, the in vivo transcriptional profiles failed to identify most CRP-dependent regulation because of the complexity of the regulatory network.
Analysis of these operons supports the hypothesis that CRP is not only a regulator of genes required for catabolism of sugars other than glucose, but also regulates the expression of a large number of other genes in E.coli.
Interleukin enhancer binding factor (ILF) binds to the interleukin-2 (IL-2) promoter and regulates IL-2 gene expression.
Our deletion studies of the fragments of ILF also suggest that the C-terminal region plays a regulatory role in DNA binding.
Stat2 is a transcriptional activator that requires sequence-specific contacts provided by stat1 and p48 for stable interaction with DNA.
Transcriptional responses to interferon (IFN) are mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) family.
The Stat1 protein is required for all transcriptional responses to IFN (both type I and type II).
Responses to type I IFN (alpha and beta) also require Stat2 and the IFN regulatory factor family protein p48, which form a heterotrimeric transcription complex with Stat1 termed ISGF3.
Stat1 homodimers formed in response to IFN-gamma treatment can also interact with p48 and function as transcriptional activators.
We now show that Stat2 is capable of forming a stable homodimer that interacts with p48, can be recruited to DNA, and can activate transcription, raising a question of why Stat1 is required.
Although Stat2 is a potent transactivator, it does not interact stably with DNA in complex with p48 alone.
Adding Stat1 increases the affinity and alters the sequence selectivity of p48-DNA interactions by contacting a half-site of its palindromic recognition motif adjacent to a p48 interaction sequence.
Thus, ISGF3 assembly involves p48 functioning as an adaptor protein to recruit Stat1 and Stat2 to an IFN-alpha-stimulated response element, Stat2 contributes a potent transactivation domain but is unable to directly contact DNA, while Stat1 stabilizes the heteromeric complex by contacting DNA directly.
Mutations at the mouse locus encoding microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (Mitf) affect the development of many cell types, including retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), melanocytes, mast cells, and osteoclasts.
MITF-A mRNA is widely expressed and represents a predominant MITF isoform in cultured RPE cells, whereas MITF-M mRNA is exclusively expressed in melanocytes and melanoma cells.
Moreover, transient cotransfection assays suggested that MITF-A activated transcription of the tyrosinase and tyrosinase-related protein 1 genes.
Alpha interferon stimulates transcription by converting the positive transcriptional regulator ISGF3 from a latent to an active form.
This receptor-mediated event occurs in the cytoplasm, with subsequent translocation of the activated factor to the nucleus.
ISGF3 gamma serves as the DNA recognition subunit, while ISGF3 alpha, which appears to consist of three polypeptides, is a target for alpha interferon signaling and serves as a regulatory component whose activation is required to form ISGF3.
ISGF3 gamma translated in vitro from recombinant clones bound DNA with a specificity indistinguishable from that of ISGF3 gamma purified from HeLa cells.
The other IRF family proteins bind DNA with a specificity related to but distinct from that of ISGF3 gamma.
These sequence similarities suggest that ISGF3 gamma and IRF proteins and the c-myb oncoprotein use a common structural motif for DNA recognition.
Recombinant ISGF3 gamma, like the natural protein, interacted with HeLa cell ISGF3 alpha to form the mature ISGF3 DNA-binding complex.
We suggest that other IRF family members may participate in signaling pathways by interacting with as yet unidentified regulatory subunits analogous to ISGF3 alpha.
Chromosomal localization of genes encoding the transcription factors, c-rel, NF-kappa Bp50, NF-kappa Bp65, and lyt-10 by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
We have used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to perform precise chromosomal mapping of the genes encoding the transcription factors c-rel, NF-kappa Bp50, NF-kappa Bp65, and lyt-10.
To decipher the mechanism of Rb function at the molecular level, we have systematically characterized a number of Rb-interacting proteins, among which is the clone C5 described here, which encodes a protein of 1,978 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 230 kDa.
Ectopic expression of the protein Trip230 in cells, but not a mutant form that does not bind to TR, enhances specifically TR-dependent transcriptional activity.
Coexpression of wild-type Rb, but not mutant Rb that fails to bind to Trip230, inhibits such activity.
Regulation of aldehyde reductase expression by STAF and CHOP.
To analyze the mechanism of basal regulation of aldehyde reductase expression, we cloned the murine gene and adjacent regulatory region and compared it to the human gene.
The 3' element binds transcription factors of the Sp1 family.
Gel-shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation as well as deletion/mutation analysis reveal that selenocysteine tRNA transcription activating factor (STAF) binds to the 5' element and drives constitutive expression of both mouse and human aldehyde reductase.
Aldehyde reductase thus becomes the fourth protein-encoding gene regulated by STAF.
The human, but not the mouse, promoter also binds C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), which competes with STAF for the same binding site.
Transfection of the human promoter into ethoxyquin-treated mouse 3T3 cells induces a 3.5-fold increase in promoter activity and a CHOP-C/EBP band appears on gel shifts performed with the 5' probe from the human aldehyde reductase promoter.
Induction is attenuated in similar transfection studies of the mouse promoter.
Mutation of the CHOP-binding site in the human promoter abolishes CHOP binding and significantly reduces ethoxyquin induction, suggesting that CHOP mediates stimulated expression in response to antioxidants in the human.
Oxidized LDL regulates macrophage gene expression through ligand activation of PPARgamma.
We demonstrate here that oxLDL activates PPARgamma-dependent transcription through a novel signaling pathway involving scavenger receptor-mediated particle uptake.
Our data suggest that the biologic effects of oxLDL are coordinated by two sets of receptors, one on the cell surface, which binds and internalizes the particle, and one in the nucleus, which is transcriptionally activated by its component lipids.
These results suggest that PPARgamma may be a key regulator of foam cell gene expression.
The interferon regulatory factor (IRF) genes encode a family of transcription factors involved in the transcriptional regulation of interferon and the interferon stimulated genes through recognition of the interferon stimulated response element.
We previously reported the cloning of a murine lymphocyte-specific IRF (mLSIRF), which was rapidly induced following B- or T-cell receptor crosslinking.
In Northern blot analysis, a single transcript of approximately 5 kb was highly expressed in spleen and peripheral blood lymphocyte.
hLSIRF mRNA was rapidly induced in peripheral T cells after crosslinking the T-cell receptor.
Analysis of tumor cell lines showed that hLSIRF mRNA was basally expressed in most B- but not T-cell lines.
Surprisingly hLSIRF mRNA was also found in the melanoma line G361 and is expressed in normal melanocytes as well.
The rearranged L-myc fusion gene (RLF) encodes a Zn-15 related zinc finger protein.
RLF is widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues, suggesting that it has a general role in transcriptional regulation.
These findings suggest that the role of the rearrangements fusing RLF and L-myc is to deregulate the tightly controlled expression of the L-myc gene.
We have isolated complementary DNA clones encoding a novel orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, termed BD73.
Unlike Rev-Erb, in which the opposite strand of the C-terminal coding region encodes the C-terminal portion of a variant thyroid hormone receptor isoform, the opposite strand of the C-terminal coding region of BD73 does not have any extensive open reading frames.
BD73 messenger RNA is expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cell lines.
In quiescent HepG2 cells, BD73 messenger RNA levels are strongly induced by planar aromatic antioxidants.
Like Rev-Erb, BD73 binds as a monomer to a DNA sequence which consists of a specific A/T-rich sequence upstream of the consensus hexameric half-site specified by the P box of the DNA-binding domain.
Under the conditions examined, neither BD73 nor Rev-Erb activated reporters containing multiple copies of their common binding site.
Thus, these two orphans may require an as yet unidentified ligand or other signal for such activation.
Together, BD73 and Rev-Erb define a subgroup of orphan receptors that bind as monomers to a half-site flanked by a specific and extended A/T-rich sequence.
Expression of the human Trm4 (hTrm4) cDNA in yeast partially complements the lack of the endogenous Trm4p enzyme.
To our knowledge, this is the first report showing intron-dependent methylation of humanpre-tRNA Leu (CAA) and identification of human gene encoding tRNA methylase responsible for this reaction.
TFIIIC in yeast and humans is required for transcription of tRNA and 5 S RNA genes by RNA polymerase III.
Affinity-purified human TFIIIC from an epitope-tagged TFIIIC35 cell line is active in binding to and in transcription of the VA1 gene in vitro.
The product of this gene binds an AP-1 site and upon cotransfection stimulates the activity of a promoter that bears an AP-1 site.
The level of activation is comparable to that of v-jun and the activity of both is further stimulated by v-fos.
Deletion mutants of the gene that lack the best conserved region in the activating domain are poorly active.
However, our data suggest that the activating domain is not confined exclusively to the conserved regions.
Interestingly, at high concentrations human jun-D displays decreased activity which cannot be explained by a simple self squelching model.
Phosphorylation of SOX9 by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A enhances SOX9's ability to transactivate a Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer.
In COS-7 cells cotransfected with PKA-Calpha and SOX9 expression plasmids, PKA enhanced the phosphorylation of wild-type SOX9 but did not affect phosphorylation of a SOX9 protein in which the two PKA phosphorylation sites (S(64) and S(211)) were mutated.
Since cAMP has previously been shown to effectively increase the mRNA levels of Col2a1 and other specific markers of chondrocyte differentiation in culture, we then asked whether PKA phosphorylation could modulate the activity of SOX9.
Addition of 8-bromo-cAMP to chondrocytes in culture increased the activity of a transiently transfected SOX9-dependent 48-bp Col2a1 chondrocyte-specific enhancer; similarly, cotransfection of PKA-Calpha increased the activity of this enhancer.
Mutations of the two PKA phosphorylation consensus sites of SOX9 markedly decreased the PKA-Calpha activation of this enhancer by SOX9.
We conclude that SOX9 is a target of cAMP signaling and that phosphorylation of SOX9 by PKA enhances its transcriptional and DNA-binding activity.
Previous studies indicated that its complementary expression together with MAP1B during nervous system development is regulated at the transcriptional level and that the mouse Map1A gene is transcribed under the control of 5' and intronic promoters.
In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms that govern the neuronal cell-specific activation of the MAP1A 5' promoter.
Among RFX transcription factor family members, RFX1 and 3 mainly interact with repressive elements in vitro.
Cotransfection studies indicated that RFX1, which is expressed ubiquitously, down-regulated the MAP1A 5' promoter activity in non-neuronal cells.
Unexpectedly, RFX3, which is abundantly expressed in neuronal cells, down-regulated the transactivity as well, when it was expressed in non-neuronal cells.
Both RFX1 and 3 did not down-regulate the transactivity in neuronal cells.
The cell type-specific down-regulation, however, does not depend simply on which RFX interacts with the elements, but seems to depend on underlying profound mechanisms.
The SRY (sex-determining region Y) gene encodes a transcription factor characterized by a DNA-binding motif termed the HMG (high mobility group) domain.
We isolated a cDNA clone with an open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 384 amino acids, which shared 83% identity to the mouse Sox18 protein.
Northern blot analysis revealed that a 1.9-kb band of human SOX18 messenger RNAs was predominantly expressed in heart, although weak signals were seen in brain, liver, testis, and leukocyte.
A member of the Polycomb group (Pc-G) of proteins, Drosophila E(z) acts as a negative regulator of the segment identity genes of the Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes.
EZH1 encodes a protein of 747 amino acids that displays 55% amino acid identity overall (70% similarity) with Drosophila E(z).
The strong sequence conservation suggest potential roles for EZH1 in human development as a transcriptional regulator and as a component of protein complexes that stably maintain heterochromatin.
EZH1 is expressed as two major transcripts in all adult and fetal human tissues surveyed; comparison of cloned cDNAs suggests that alternative splicing may account for at least part of the transcript size difference.
Analysis of one cDNA revealed an unusual splicing event involving EZH1 and a tandemly linked gene GPR2 and suggests a potential mechanism for modifying the EZH1 protein in the conserved C-terminal domain.
The oxidative stressor arsenite activates vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA transcription by an ATF4-dependent mechanism.
Aberrant retinal expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) leading to neovascularization is a central feature of age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, two leading causes of vision loss.
Oxidative stress is suggested to occur in retinal tissue during age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy and is suspected in the mechanism of VEGF expression in these diseases.
Arsenite, a thiol-reactive oxidative stressor, induces VEGF expression by a HIF-1alpha-independent mechanism.
Previously, we demonstrated that homocysteine, an endoplasmic reticulum stressor, increases VEGF transcription by a mechanism dependent upon activating transcription factor ATF4.
Because ATF4 is expressed in response to oxidative stress, we hypothesized that ATF4 was also responsible for increased VEGF transcription in response to arsenite.
We now show that arsenite increased steady state levels of VEGF mRNA and activated transcription from a VEGF promoter construct.
Overexpression of ATF4 was sufficient to activate the VEGF promoter, and arsenite cooperated with exogenous ATF4 to further activate the promoter.
A complex containing ATF4 binds a DNA element at +1767 bp relative to the VEGF transcription start site, and DNA binding activity is increased by arsenite treatment.
In addition, the ability of a thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, to inhibit the effect of arsenite on VEGF expression coincided with its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and ATF4 protein expression.
Thus, arsenite-induced up-regulation of VEGF gene transcription occurs by an ATF4-dependent mechanism.
MAZ, a zinc finger protein, binds to c-MYC and C2 gene sequences regulating transcriptional initiation and termination.
ME1a1, a 16-base-pair nuclear factor binding site residing between the c-MYC P1 and P2 transcription initiation sites, is required for P2 activity.
A cDNA encoding a 477-amino acid zinc finger protein designated MAZ (MYC-associated zinc finger protein) was cloned from a HeLa lambda gt11 library by screening with a concatamerized ME1a1 binding site probe.
Its mRNA was present in all human tissues tested except for kidney, as a doublet of approximately 2.5 and 2.7 kilobases, along with differentially expressed minor species.
MAZ bound specifically to the wild-type ME1a1 sequence but not to a ME1a1 mutant that also failed to yield P2 activity.
When expressed as a fusion protein in a pMAL-c vector, MAZ binds with specificity to a GA box sequence (GGGAGGG) found in the c-MYC P2 promoter, to the P2 attenuator region within the gene's first exon, and to a related sequence involved in the transcriptional termination of the C2 gene.
MAZ may encode a transcription factor with dual roles in transcription initiation and termination.
E2F-6, a member of the E2F family that can behave as a transcriptional repressor.
The E2F family of proteins is required to establish the correct cell-cycle-dependent transcription of genes that direct the process of cell division.
All previously identified E2F proteins can act in a similar manner; depending on whether or not they are associated with the cell cycle inhibitors the retinoblastoma protein (pRB), p107, or p130, they can either repress or activate the transcription of E2F-responsive genes.
However, it is not regulated by pRB, p107, or p130, and it is unable to activate transcription.
Instead, it can act to repress the transcription of E2F responsive genes by countering the activity of the other E2F complexes via a pRB-, p107-, or p130-independent mechanism.
We have cloned a human cDNA from a new gene, spi-B, on the basis of its homology with the DNA-binding domain of the Spi-1/PU.1 putative oncogene product.
spi-B codes for a protein of 262 amino acids presenting 43% overall identity with Spi-1.
We showed that the Spi-B protein is able to bind the purine-rich sequence (PU box) recognized by Spi-1/PU.1 and to activate transcription of a reporter plasmid containing PU boxes.
spi-B, like spi-1, was found to be expressed in various murine and human hematopoietic cell lines except T lymphoid cell lines.
The monomeric beta subunit is ubiquitously expressed, whereas expression of the three alpha subunits isolated previously seems to be restricted mainly to hematopoietic tissues.
Transcriptional repression by a novel member of the bZIP family of transcription factors.
We describe here a novel member of the bZIP family of DNA-binding proteins, designated E4BP4, that displays an unusual DNA-binding specificity which overlaps that of the activating transcription factor family of factors.
When expressed in a transient transfection assay with a suitable reporter plasmid, E4BP4 strongly repressed transcription in a DNA-binding-site-dependent manner.
The human forkhead protein FREAC-2 contains two functionally redundant activation domains and interacts with TBP and TFIIB.
Forkhead-related activator 2 (FREAC-2) is a human transcription factor expressed in lung and placenta that binds to cis-elements in several lung-specific genes.
Activation domain 1 consists of the most C-terminal 23 amino acids of FREAC-2 and contains a sequence motif conserved in an activation domain of another forkhead protein, FREAC-1.
FREAC-2 was shown to interact in vitro with TBP and TFIIB.
TFIIB binds FREAC-2 close to the cleft between its two globular domains.
The part of FREAC-2 that binds TBP was mapped to 21 amino acids in the C-terminal end of the forkhead domain.
Overexpression of TFIIB potentiates activation by FREAC-2 in a manner dependent on the FREAC-2 activation domains.
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a common motor neuron degenerative disease that results from reduced levels of, or mutations in, the Survival of Motor Neurons (SMN) protein.
SMN interacts with spliceosomal snRNP proteins and is critical for snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm.
We show that a dominant-negative mutant SMN (SMNdeltaN27) causes a dramatic reorganization of snRNPs in the nucleus.
Furthermore, SMNdeltaN27 inhibits pre-mRNA splicing in vitro, while wild-type SMN stimulates splicing.
SMN mutants found in SMA patients cannot stimulate splicing.
Dlx-2 (also called Tes-1), a mammalian member of the Distal-less family of homeobox genes, is expressed during murine fetal development in spatially restricted domains of the forebrain.
Searching for a candidate neurological mutation that might involve this gene, we have assigned the human and mouse loci to regions of conserved synteny on human chromosome 2, region cen--q33, and mouse chromosome 2 by Southern analysis of somatic cell hybrid lines.
Quantitative analysis of the nuclear and cytoplasmic labeling densities for the mRNAs coding for TP1 and HP1 showed the presence of transcripts in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of round spermatids until the elongation phase.
Transcripts accumulated in the spermatid cytoplasm without any particular cellular compartmentalization.
Nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor 1 regulates the müllerian inhibiting substance gene: a link to the sex determination cascade.
In primary Sertoli cells, the orphan nuclear receptor, steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), regulates the MIS gene by binding to a conserved upstream regulatory element.
In heterologous (HeLa) cells, MIS gene activation by SF-1 requires removal of the SF-1 ligand-binding domain, implicating a Sertoli cell-specific ligand or cofactor.
Finally, the sexually dimorphic expression of SF-1 during development coincides with MIS expression and müllerian duct regression.
We propose that SF-1 regulates MIS in vivo and participates directly in the process of mammalian sex determination.
Recombinant NFAT1 (NFATp) is regulated by calcineurin in T cells and mediates transcription of several cytokine genes.
Transcription factors of the NFAT family play a key role in the transcription of cytokine genes and other genes during the immune response.
We have identified two new isoforms of the transcription factor NFAT1 (previously termed NFATp) that are the predominant isoforms expressed in murine and human T cells.
When expressed in Jurkat T cells, recombinant NFAT1 is regulated, as expected, by the calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, and its function is inhibited by the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporin A (CsA).
Transactivation by recombinant NFAT1 in Jurkat T cells requires dual stimulation with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; this activity is potentiated by coexpression of constitutively active calcineurin and is inhibited by CsA.
Immunocytochemical analysis indicates that recombinant NFAT1 localizes in the cytoplasm of transiently transfected T cells and translocates into the nucleus in a CsA-sensitive manner following ionomycin stimulation.
When expressed in COS cells, however, NFAT1 is capable of transactivation, but it is not regulated correctly: its subcellular localization and transcriptional function are not affected by stimulation of the COS cells with ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.
Recombinant NFAT1 can mediate transcription of the interleukin-2, interleukin-4, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor promoters in T cells, suggesting that NFAT1 contributes to the CsA-sensitive transcription of these genes during the immune response.
A SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex, E-RC1, is required for tissue-specific transcriptional regulation by EKLF in vitro.
Erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF) is necessary for stage-specific expression of the human beta-globin gene.
We show that EKLF requires a SWI/SNF-related chromatin remodeling complex, EKLF coactivator-remodeling complex 1 (E-RC1), to generate a DNase I hypersensitive, transcriptionally active beta-globin promoter on chromatin templates in vitro.
E-RC1 contains BRG1, BAF170, BAF155, and INI1 (BAF47) homologs of yeast SWI/SNF subunits, as well as a subunit unique to higher eukaryotes, BAF57, which is critical for chromatin remodeling and transcription with EKLF.
E-RC1 displays functional selectivity toward transcription factors, since it cannot activate expression of chromatin-assembled HIV-1 templates with the E box-binding protein TFE-3.
Thus, a member of the SWI/SNF family acts directly in transcriptional activation and may regulate subsets of genes by selectively interacting with specific DNA-binding proteins.
Expression of the Bcl-3 proto-oncogene suppresses p53 activation.
While Bcl-3 expression in cancer was originally thought to be limited to B-cell lymphomas with a 14;19 chromosomal translocation, more recent evidence indicates that expression of this presumptive oncoprotein is significantly more widespread in cancer.
Experiments presented here indicate that Bcl-3 is inducible by DNA damage and is required for the induction of Hdm2 gene expression and the suppression of persistent p53 activity.
Furthermore, constitutive expression of Bcl-3 suppresses DNA damage-induced p53 activation and inhibits p53-induced apoptosis through a mechanism that is at least partly dependent on the up-regulation of Hdm2.
The results provide insight into a mechanism whereby altered expression of Bcl-3 leads to tumorigenic potential.
Bax is encoded by six exons and demonstrates a complex pattern of alternative RNA splicing that predicts a 21 kd membrane (alpha) and two forms of cytosolic protein (beta and gamma).
One cDNA identified encodes a new member of the bHLH-Zip protein family, Mad.
Human Mad protein homodimerizes poorly but binds Max in vitro, forming a sequence-specific DNA binding complex with properties very similar to those of Myc-Max.
The homeobox gene GBX2, a target of the myb oncogene, mediates autocrine growth and monocyte differentiation.
The homeobox gene GBX2 was identified as a target gene of the v-Myb oncoprotein encoded by the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV).
GBX2 activation by c-Myb requires signal transduction emanating from the cell surface while the leukemogenic AMV v-Myb constitutively induces the GBX2 gene.
Ectopic expression of GBX2 in growth factor-dependent myeloblasts induces monocytic features and independence from exogenous cytokines, reflecting distinct features of AMV-transformed cells.
Here we report the characterization of the human gene encoding this factor.
The DNA-binding high mobility group (HMG) box of TCF-1 is encoded by the closely spaced exons VI and VII.
Differential splicing involves an alternative exon (IX) and three splice acceptor sites in exon X.
In particular, the HMG boxes encoded by the two TCF genes are virtually identical.
The promoter does not contain TCF-1/TCF-1 alpha binding sites and is therefore not autoregulated.
Dimerization of NF-KB2 with RelA(p65) regulates DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and inhibition by an I kappa B-alpha (MAD-3).
Inducible expression of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is regulated by a cellular transcription factor, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B).
NF-kappa B is composed of distinct subunits; five independent genes, NFKB1(p105), NFKB2(p100), RelA(p65), c-rel and relB, that encode related proteins that bind to kappa B DNA elements have been isolated.
We have previously found that NFKB2(p49/p52) acts in concert with RelA(p65) to stimulate the HIV enhancer in Jurkat T-leukemia cells.
Here we examine the biochemical basis for the transcriptional regulation of HIV by NFKB2.
Consistent with these findings, in vitro transcription was stimulated 18-fold by the addition of preformed, heterodimeric NFKB2(p49)/RelA(p65) protein.
Transcriptional activation of the HIV enhancer was also subject to regulation by recently cloned I kappa B-alpha(MAD-3).
Functional activation of an HIV reporter plasmid by p49/p65 in transiently transfected Jurkat T-leukemia cells was also inhibited by coexpression of MAD-3.
These data suggest that binding of the NFKB2 subunit to the HIV enhancer is facilitated by RelA(p65) and that this NFKB2(p49)/p65 heterodimeric complex mediates transcriptional activation which is subject to regulation by MAD-3.
BCL6 can repress transcription from the human immunodeficiency virus type I promoter/enhancer region.
The gene BCL6 encodes a zinc finger protein with similarities to transcription factors.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the full-length BCL6 protein extracted from transfected COS cells and a bacterially expressed truncated protein containing the BCL6 zinc fingers can bind specifically to DNA from the U3 promoter/enhancer region of HIV-1.
Transient transfections were performed to analyze the effects of the BCL6 protein on luciferase expression driven by the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences.
Full-length BCL6 significantly repressed luciferase activity compared with multiple controls.
We conclude that the BCL6 protein can bind to the HIV-1 promoter-enhancer region and contains a domain upstream of its zinc fingers that can repress transcription from the HIV-1 LTR.
Apoptosis is regulated by interaction of viral and cellular BCL-2 family antiapoptotic proteins with various pro-apoptotic proteins, several of which are also members of the BCL-2 family.
Cellular protein BNIP3 is a BCL-2 family proapoptotic protein that interacts with viral antiapoptosis proteins such as adenoviruses E1B-19K and EBV-BHRF1 and cellular antiapoptosis proteins such as BCL-2 and BCL-xL.
Database searches indicate that the human genome encodes an open reading frame for a protein, BNIP3alpha, that shares substantial homology with BNIP3.
The BNIP3alpha open reading frame encodes a protein of 219 amino acids that contains a conserved BH3 domain and a COOH-terminal trans-membrane domain, characteristic of several BCL-2 family proapoptotic proteins.
Overexpression of BNIP3alpha in transfected cells results in apoptosis and suppresses the antiapoptosis activity of E1B-19K and BCL-xL.
Northern blot analysis reveals that BNIP3alpha is expressed ubiquitously in most human tissues.
In contrast, BNIP3 is expressed well in several human tissues and less abundantly in certain tissues such as placenta and lung.
These results suggest that although BNIP3 and BNIP3alpha may promote apoptosis simultaneously in most human tissues, BNIP3alpha may play a more universal role.
Large-scale identification and characterization of human genes that activate NF-kappaB and MAPK signaling pathways.
We have carried out a large-scale identification and characterization of human genes that activate the NF-kappaB and MARK signaling pathways.
For analysis of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, we introduced each of the cDNAs into human embryonic kidney 293 cells and examined whether it activated the transcription of a luciferase reporter gene driven by a promoter containing the consensus NF-kappaB binding sites.
In total, we identified 299 cDNAs that activate the NF-kappaB pathway, and we classified them into 83 genes, including 30 characterized activator genes of the NF-kappaB pathway, 28 genes whose involvement in the NF-kappaB pathways have not been characterized and 25 novel genes.
We then carried out a similar analysis for the identification of genes that activate the MARK pathway, utilizing the same cDNA resource.
We assayed 145 000 cDNAs and identified 57 genes that activate the MARK pathway.
Spt3 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcription factor that is required in vivo for the transcription of a number of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes.
We report the cloning of the gene encoding the human homologue of Spt3, SUPT3H, and its initial functional analysis.
While expression of the full-length SUPT3H is unable to complement an spt3Delta mutation, expression of a human-yeast chimeric gene that contains 42% human sequences can partially complement an spt3Delta mutation.
These data suggest that the transcriptional control carried out by Spt3 has been conserved from yeast to human.
Nuclear distribution of prothymosin alpha and parathymosin: evidence that prothymosin alpha is associated with RNA synthesis processing and parathymosin with early DNA replication.
This implies that prothymosin alpha and parathymosin are involved in transcription and replication, respectively.
Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of NERF with those of other members of the Ets family reveals that the level of homology to ELF-1, which is involved in the regulation of several T- and B-cell-specific genes, is highest.
The presence of two predominant NERF transcripts in various fetal and adult human tissues is due to at least three alternative splice products, NERF-1a, NERF-1b, and NERF-2, which differ in their amino termini and their expression in different tissues.
Only NERF-2 and ELF-1, and not NERF-1a and NERF-1b, function as transcriptional activators of the lyn and blk gene promoters, although all isoforms of NERF bind with affinities similar to those of ELF-1 to a variety of Ets binding sites in, among others, the blk, lck, lyn, mb-1, and immunoglobulin H genes and are expressed at similar levels.
Since NERF and ELF-1 are coexpressed in B and T cells, both might be involved in the regulation of the same genes.
A novel genetic system to isolate a dominant negative effector on DNA-binding activity of Oct-2.
Recent studies have revealed that interactions between transcription factors play an important role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells.
To isolate cDNA clones that dominantly inhibit the DNA-binding activity of Oct-2, chosen as a representative factor, we have developed a novel screening system.
Oct-2 expressed in this tester strain represses the expression of the reporter gene and changes the phenotype of the cell from Lac+to Lac-.
Introduction of a cDNA expression library prepared from a human T-cell line into the Oct-2-harboring tester strain allowed selection of three Lac+clones out of 1 x 10(5) transformants.
One of them, hT86, encoding a putative zinc finger protein was found to derepress beta-galactosidase activity in the Oct-2-harboring tester strain at the transcriptional level.
In gel mobility shift assays, hT86 attenuated the intensity of the retarded band composed of the octamer probe and Oct-2, suggesting a dominant negative effect on the DNA-binding activity of Oct-2.
The strategy described here provides a new approach for studying protein-protein interactions that govern the complex regulation of gene expression.
Both cyclin T1 and T2 are ubiquitously expressed.
Cotransfection experiments indicated that all three CDK9/cyclin combinations dramatically activated the CMV promoter.
Identification of a novel RING finger protein as a coregulator in steroid receptor-mediated gene transcription.
Using the DNA-binding domain of androgen receptor (AR) as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified a small nuclear RING finger protein, termed SNURF, that interacts with AR in a hormone-dependent fashion in both yeast and mammalian cells.
Physical interaction between AR and SNURF was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts and by protein-protein affinity chromatography.
SNURF mRNA is expressed in a variety of human and rat tissues.
Overexpression of SNURF in cultured mammalian cells enhanced not only androgen, glucocorticoid, and progesterone receptor-dependent transactivation but also basal transcription from steroid-regulated promoters.
Mutation of two of the potential Zn2+ coordinating cysteines to serines in the RING finger completely abolished the ability of SNURF to enhance basal transcription, whereas its ability to activate steroid receptor-dependent transcription was maintained, suggesting that there are separate domains in SNURF that mediate interactions with different regulatory factors.
SNURF is capable of interacting in vitro with the TATA-binding protein, and the RING finger domain is needed for this interaction.
Collectively, we have identified and characterized a ubiquitously expressed RING finger protein, SNURF, that may function as a bridging factor and regulate steroid receptor-dependent transcription by a mechanism different from those of previously identified coactivator or integrator proteins.
I think TFBRR is right because binding to the human AFP gene enhancer does not necessarily mean positive regulation of AFP.
We have isolated a full-length cDNA encoding a protein (ATBF1) that binds to an AT-rich motif in the human alpha-fetoprotein gene enhancer.
The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA revealed that this is the largest DNA-binding protein (306 kDa) known to date, containing four homeodomains, 17 zinc finger motifs, and a number of segments potentially involved in transcriptional regulation.
Although the exact function of this protein has not been determined, these structural features suggest that ATBF1 plays a transcriptional regulatory role.
The tal gene undergoes chromosome translocation in T cell leukemia and potentially encodes a helix-loop-helix protein.
The chromosome 1 breakpoints of these patients lie within a kilobasepair of each other, and thus define a genetic locus (designated tal) involved in T cell oncogenesis.
Moreover, we have identified sequences within tal that potentially encode an amphipathic helix-loop-helix motif, a DNA-binding domain found in a variety of proteins that control cell growth and differentiation.
The homology domain of tal is especially related to that of lyl-1, a gene on chromosome 19 that has also been implicated in T cell oncogenesis.
Hence, tal and lyl-1 encode a distinct family of helix-loop-helix proteins involved in the malignant development of lymphocytes.
A redox factor protein, ref1, is involved in negative gene regulation by extracellular calcium.
A rise in extracellular calcium (Ca2+e) suppresses not only secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH) but also expression of the PTH gene to ensure constant plasma Ca2+ level.
A nuclear protein(s) in a wide variety of cells bound to the specific DNA elements (negative Ca2+ responsive elements, nCaREs) in the human PTH gene in sequence-specific and Ca2+e concentration-dependent manners.
Our Southwestern cloning revealed that a redox factor protein (ref1), which was known to activate several transcription factors via alterations of their redox state, belonged to an nCaRE binding protein.
The level of ref1 mRNA as well as of its protein was elevated by an increase in Ca2+e concentration.
In gel shift assay, anti-ref1 antibody eliminated formation of the nCaRE-protein complex.
We also found that there was another protein(s) interacting with nCaREs and ref1.
Further, experiments with an antisense-ref cDNA expression vector introduced into cultured cells suggested that DNA (nCaRE)-ref1 interaction led to Ca2+e-mediated transcriptional suppression.
Thus, it is concluded that ref1 possesses transcription repressor activity in addition to its function as a transcriptional auxiliary protein.
Role of 14-3-3 eta as a positive regulator of the glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activation.
It is known that 14-3-3 family proteins interact with GR and regulate its transcriptional activity.
Recently, it has been proposed that ligand-activated degradation of GR occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation pathway and that inhibition of proteasomal activity induces up-regulation of GR and enhances the transcriptional activity of GR.
To examine the function of 14-3-3eta in the glucocorticoid-dependent signal pathway, we studied the regulatory role of 14-3-3eta in ligand-induced GR transcriptional activation.
14-3-3eta Enhanced the transcriptional activity of GR, and the levels of GR were higher in cells transfected with the 14-3-3eta expression vector in response to glucocorticoid.
The GR level increased in both cytosol and nucleus, and endogenous GR was also elevated by 14-3-3eta in HeLa cells.
14-3-3eta Inhibited ligand-induced down-regulation of GR.
Proteasomal inhibition did not induce any synergistic effect on the 14-3-3eta-induced increase in GR in response to glucocorticoid, and inhibition of translation did not block elevation of GR by 14-3-3eta, indicating that 14-3-3eta induces stabilization of GR.
These results suggest that 14-3-3eta functions as a positive regulator in the glucocorticoid signal pathway by blocking the degradation of GR and inducing an elevation of GR, thus enhancing the transcriptional activity of GR.
Evidence that dynamin-2 functions as a signal-transducing GTPase.
Here, we present new evidence that the ubiquitously expressed isoform dynamin-2 (dyn2) can also function in a signal transduction pathway(s).
A </=5-fold increase of dyn2 relative to endogenous levels activates the transcription factor p53 and induces apoptosis, as demonstrated by reduced cell proliferation, DNA fragmentation, and caspase-3 activation.
A mutant defective in GTP binding does not trigger apoptosis, indicating that increased levels of dyn2.GTP, rather than protein levels per se, are required to transduce signals that activate p53.
Our data suggest that dyn2 can act as a signal transducing GTPase affecting transcriptional regulation.
The PAX7 gene encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the PAX family of developmental control genes.
The gene encodes a predicted protein of 520 amino acids that is 47 amino acids longer at the carboxy end than the highly related PAX3 protein.
We demonstrate here that human B cells express a ryanodine receptor (RYR) that functions as a Ca2+ release channel during the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-stimulated Ca2+ signaling process.
Immunoblotting studies showed that both human primary CD19(+) B and DAKIKI cells express a 565-kDa immunoreactive protein that is indistinguishable in molecular size and immunoreactivity from the RYR.
Selective reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and sequencing of cloned cDNA indicated that the major isoform of the RYR expressed in primary CD19(+) B and DAKIKI cells is identical to the skeletal muscle type (RYR1).
Nrf1 in a complex with fosB, c-jun, junD and ATF2 forms the AP1 component at the TNF alpha promoter in stimulated mast cells.
Cap 'n' collar-basic leucine zipper (CNC-bZIP) proteins are widely implicated in developmental processes throughout different species.
Evidence is accumulating that some of them are also participating in induced gene expression in the adult.
Here we show that the three CNC-bZIP members NF-E2, Nrf1 and Nrf2 are constitutively expressed in the murine mast cell line CPII and that they form transcription factor complexes with several AP1 binding proteins.
Upon induction, complexes are observed at the 2 x NF-E2 consensus binding site and the extended kappa3/AP1(+) site of the TNFalpha promoter.
The interaction of Nrf1 with c -jun, junD, fosB and ATF2 in mast cells is in contrast to the recently reported binding of Nrf1 alone at the kappa3/AP1(-) site in dendritic cells.
We speculated that this may be the result of the expression of isoforms of Nrf1 in mast cells.
Expression of this altered binding/interaction domain interferes with TNFalpha induction, indicating an interaction of this splice variant with the active AP1/NF-AT complex at this promoter.
Mitochondrial transcriptional factor 1 (mtTF1) is required for both transcription and replication of mammalian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and it has two consensus sequences of HMG (high mobility group) boxes.
In studies on the regulation of gene expression of mtTF1, we examined the steady state level of the mRNA in cultured HeLa cells.
The region of the deletion corresponds to the second HMG-box, which may interact directly with DNA.
We examined the structure of the genomic gene encoding the human mtTF1 to determine the mechanism of the deletion.
Three human RNA polymerase III-specific subunits form a subcomplex with a selective function in specific transcription initiation.
Transcription by RNA polymerase III involves recruitment of the polymerase by template-bound accessory factors, followed by initiation, elongation, and termination steps.
An immunopurification approach has been used to demonstrate that human RNA Pol III is composed of 16 subunits, some of which are apparently modified in HeLa cells.
Partial denaturing conditions and sucrose gradient sedimentation at high salt result in the dissociation of a subcomplex that includes hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62.
Cognate cDNAs were isolated and shown to encode three subunits that are specific to RNA Pol III and homologous to three yeast subunits.
The human RNA Pol III core lacking the subcomplex functions in transcription elongation and termination following nonspecific initiation on a tailed template, but fails to show promoter-dependent transcription initiation in conjunction with accessory factors.
The capability for specific transcription initiation can be restored either by the natural subcomplex or by a stable subcomplex composed of recombinant hRPC32, hRPC39, and hRPC62 polypeptides.
One component (hRPC39) of this subcomplex interacts physically with both hTBP and hTFIIIB90, two subunits of human RNA Pol III transcription initiation factor IIIB.
These data strongly suggest that the hRPC32-hRPC39-hRPC62 subcomplex directs RNA Pol III binding to the TFIIIB-DNA complex via the interactions between TFIIIB and hRPC39.
Using the complex structure of bone morphogenetic protein-2 bound to its type I receptor (ALK3) as a guide, we introduced extracellular domain mutations in the context of the truncated ALK4 (ALK4-trunc) construct and assessed the ability of the mutants to inhibit activin function.
We have identified five hydrophobic amino acid residues on the ALK4 extracellular domain (Leu40, Ile70, Val73, Leu75, and Pro77) that, when mutated to alanine, have substantial effects on ALK4-trunc dominant negative activity.
In addition, eleven mutants partially affected activin binding to ALK4.
In addition three of the residues required for activin binding to ALK4 are conserved on the type I TGF-beta receptor ALK5, suggesting the corresponding region on ALK5 may be important for TGF-beta binding.
Eukaryotes respond to the presence of unfolded protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by up-regulating the transcription of genes encoding ER protein chaperones, such as BiP.
We have isolated a novel human cDNA encoding a homolog to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ire1p, a proximal sensor for this signal transduction pathway in yeast.
hIre1p expressed in mammalian cells displayed intrinsic autophosphorylation activity and an endoribonuclease activity that cleaved the 5' splice site of yeast HAC1 mRNA, a substrate for the endoribonuclease activity of yeast Ire1p.
Expression of Ire1p mRNA was autoregulated through a process that required a functional hIre1p kinase activity.
Finally, overexpression of wild-type hIre1p constitutively activated a reporter gene under transcriptional control of the rat BiP promoter, whereas expression of a catalytically inactive hIre1p acted in a trans-dominant-negative manner to prevent transcriptional activation of the BiP promoter in response to ER stress induced by inhibition of N-linked glycosylation.
Nucleolar transcription factor hUBF contains a DNA-binding motif with homology to HMG proteins.
The eukaryotic upstream binding factor (UBF), recognizes the ribosomal RNA gene promoter and activates transcription mediated by RNA polymerase I through cooperative interactions with the species-specific factor, SL1.
Expression, cellular localization and in vitro transcription studies establish that cloned hUBF encodes a nucleolar factor that binds specifically to the upstream control element and core of the rRNA gene promoter to activate transcription in a binding site-dependent manner.
PU.1 (Spi-1) autoregulates its expression in myeloid cells.
PU.1 (Spi-1), a member of the Ets transcription factor family, is predominantly expressed in myeloid (granulocytes, monocytes and macrophages) and B cells.
PU.1 is upregulated early during commitment of multipotential progenitors to the myeloid lineages and inhibition of PU.1 function in human CD34+ progenitors prior to this upregulation blocks myeloid colony formation.
Since PU.1 expression appears to play a role in hematopoietic development, we characterized the PU.1 promoter.
Here we report that the murine PU.1 promoter, as well as the human promoter, demonstrate tissue-specific reporter gene expression in myeloid cell lines but not in T cells and HeLa (non-hematopoietic cells) cells.
Deletion analysis of the PU.1 promoter indicates that tissue-specific functional elements are encoded in the -61 to -39 bp and -7 to +34 bp regions.
The second contains a binding site at +20 bp for both PU.1 itself and the related ets family member Spi-B.
In vivo footprinting assays demonstrate that a hypersensitive band was detected at the PU.1 site in myeloid cells but not in HeLa.
A mutation of the PU.1 site which abolished PU.1 binding caused a significant decrease in promoter activity.
Mutation of the Oct and/or Sp1 site results in a lesser decrease of promoter activity in myeloid cells.
Co-transfection of PU.1 or Spi-B in cells lacking PU.1 and Spi-B specifically transactivated a minimal promoter containing the PU.1 binding site, indicating that PU.1 can activate its own promoter elements in an autoregulatory loop.
Positive autoregulation of the PU.1 promoter may play an important role in the function of PU.1 in myeloid cells.
Each new SAP repressed transcription when tethered to DNA.
Furthermore, repression correlated with mSin3A binding, suggesting that the new SAPs are components of functional mSin3A corepressor complexes.
A region of antisense RNA from human p120 cDNA with high homology to mouse p120 cDNA inhibits NIH 3T3 proliferation.
The human nucleolar p120 protein is a proliferation-associated antigen which is expressed in G1 and peaks during the early S phase of the cell cycle.
Overexpression of the human p120 protein caused the transformation of NIH 3T3 cells and expression of an antisense p120 construct inhibited the growth of NIH 3T3 cells (Perlaky et al., Cancer Res., 52:428-436, 1992).
The middle region of the antisense p120 RNA was found to be almost as inhibitory as the full length antisense construct but the 5' and 3' antisense portions did not affect NIH 3T3 cell proliferation.
Based on this homology, the observed inhibitory effects of the middle portion of antisense human p120 RNA may be related to suppression of mouse p120 expression by RNA:RNA duplex formation.
Characterization of the genomic structure, chromosomal location, promoter, and development expression of the alpha-globin transcription factor CP2.
We recently cloned murine and human cDNAs that encode CP2, a cellular transcription factor that interacts with the alpha-globin promoter as well as with additional cellular and viral promoter elements.
Lastly, a study of the pattern of CP2 gene expression showed that the factor was expressed in all adult and fetal murine tissues examined from at least day 9.5 of development.
Cloning and characterization of a human ribosomal protein gene with enhanced expression in fetal and neoplastic cells.
To assess the possible effects of HBV regulatory sequences (e.g., the enhancer) on expression of neighboring host genes we have screened for cellular genes that are both overexpressed and adjacent to integrated HBV sequences in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
The cloned cDNA for one such gene encodes a protein similar to the E. coli L-3 ribosomal protein which is thought to play a role in mRNA binding to the ribosome.
The protein encoded by the cDNA localizes to the nucleolus and is also found in ribosomes; possibly it is the mammalian homologue of L-3 (MRL3).
The expression of MRL3 is higher in colon carcinoma and lymphoma cell lines than in normal liver, placenta and diploid fibroblasts, and is also higher in fetal than in adult liver.
Therefore, MRL3 overexpression seems to be a property of rapidly dividing cells and is not directly linked to oncogenesis.
Human TAF(II)135 potentiates transcriptional activation by the AF-2s of the retinoic acid, vitamin D3, and thyroid hormone receptors in mammalian cells.
We report for the first time the cloning of a complete cDNA encoding the human TFIID subunit hTAF(II)135 (hTAF(II)130).
We show that expression of hTAF(II)135 in mammalian cells strongly and selectively potentiates transcriptional stimulation by the activation function-2 (AF-2) of the retinoic acid, thyroid hormone, and vitamin D3 receptors (RAR, TR, and VDR), but does not affect the AF-2s of the estrogen (ER) or retinoid X (RXR) receptors.
The coactivator activity requires an hTAF(II)135 region that is located between the conserved domains but is itself not conserved in dTAF(II)110 and hTAF(II)105.
Expression of hTAF(II)135 also stimulates RAR AF-2 activity when a promoter with a low-affinity TATA element (TGTA) is used, indicating that hTAF(II)135 overexpression compensates for the low-affinity of TBP for this promoter and may facilitate the recruitment of TFIID by the RAR AF-2.
Identification of a novel mammalian member of the NSF/CDC48p/Pas1p/TBP-1 family through heterologous expression in yeast.
These suppressors, SKD1 and SKD2 (suppressor of K+ transport growth defect), were cDNAs encoding members of a family of ATPases involved in membrane fusion (N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein, NSF), cell division cycle regulation (CDC48p), peroxisome assembly (Pas1p), and transcriptional regulation (TBP-1).
Requirement of RSF and FACT for transcription of chromatin templates in vitro.
Transcription of naked DNA in vitro requires the general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II.
However, this minimal set of factors is not sufficient for transcription when the DNA template is packaged into chromatin.
Here, a factor that facilitates activator-dependent transcription initiation on chromatin templates was purified.
Polymerases that initiate transcription with RSF can only extend their transcripts in the presence of FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription).
Thus, the minimal factor requirements for activator-dependent transcription on chromatin templates in vitro have been defined.
RET finger protein is a transcriptional repressor and interacts with enhancer of polycomb that has dual transcriptional functions.
Here we show that RFP interacts with Enhancer of Polycomb (EPC) and strongly represses the gene transcription.
Using the luciferase reporter-gene assay, we found that they repress the gene transcription activity independent of the differences of enhancers and promoters used, although the repressive activity of RFP was much stronger than that of EPC.
These results suggested that RFP may be involved in the epigenetic gene silencing mechanism cooperating with Polycomb group proteins and that EPC is a unique molecule with both repressive and transactivating activities.
Evidence for regulation by Wilms' tumor suppressor gene (WT-1) and p53.
We describe the cloning and sequence analysis of a nearly full-length cDNA as well as a corresponding 5.2-kilobase pair genomic fragment encoding FREAC-4, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors.
Significant levels of luciferase activity were detected when this construct was transfected into two kidney-derived cell lines, 293 and COS-7 cells, whereas only background reporter gene expression was observed in a cell line of nonkidney origin.
Cotransfections with plasmids expressing WT-1, WTAR (a mutated form of WT-1), p53, and a mutated form of p53 revealed a complex pattern of regulation with a 3-fold induction with WT-1, a 7-fold induction with mutated p53, and a 4-fold repression with wild-type p53.
This fragment is shown to contain at least one cis-element that is capable of interacting with recombinant WT-1.
The upstream region of the human homeobox gene HOX3D is a target for regulation by retinoic acid and HOX homeoproteins.
We studied the structure, regulation and expression of HOX3D, a human homeobox gene located in the HOX3 cluster on chromosome 12.
HOX3D is developmentally regulated during embryogenesis and is activated by retinoic acid (RA) in cultured embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells.
Transfection of HOX3D upstream genomic sequences linked to a reporter gene allowed the functional definition of its promoter, containing a canonical TATA element.
This promoter directs the expression of the reporter gene in EC cells after induction with RA, and binds RA-induced nuclear factor(s) through a conserved palindromic sequence located approximately 100 bp upstream of the transcription start site.
The HOX3D promoter is transactivated in both human and murine cells when cotransfected with vectors expressing the protein product of the upstream gene HOX3C and the paralogs of further upstream genes in the HOX4 cluster (i.e. HOX4D, HOX4C and the murine Hox 4.3).
The HOX3D protein, and those encoded by the downstream gene HOX3E and its paralog HOX4B are instead inactive.
HOX4C and HOX4D proteins synthesized in bacteria bind to the same conserved sequence located around position -120, as well as to the TATA box and immediately upstream and downstream nucleotides.
These data provide evidence that cross-regulatory interactions between mammalian homeogenes take place in cultured cells, thus raising the possibility that a regulatory network may exist in vivo.
The sequences on the HOX3D promoter involved in cross-regulation are different from those binding nuclear factors induced by RA.
A variety of cellular proteins bind to cellular and viral enhancer elements.
In addition, it has been found that AP-2 binds to the SV40 T-antigen.
AP-2 activity is mediated by both the state of cellular differentiation and changes in signal transduction pathways, suggesting a potential role of AP-2 in the regulation of diverse cellular processes.
As part of an effort to examine the chromosomal organization of cellular genes encoding transcription factors, we report the mapping of the gene encoding AP-2 to human chromosome 6p22.3-24 by analysis of somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization to chromosomes.
Formation of pluripotent stem cells in the mammalian embryo depends on the POU transcription factor Oct4.
Oct4 is a mammalian POU transcription factor expressed by early embryo cells and germ cells.
Expansion of trophoblast precursors is restored, however, by an Oct4 target gene product, fibroblast growth factor-4.
Therefore, Oct4 also determines paracrine growth factor signaling from stem cells to the trophectoderm.
Cloning and mapping of SMARCA5 encoding hSNF2H, a novel human homologue of Drosophila ISWI.
We have isolated a novel cDNA encoding a peptide with 86% sequence homology to hSNF2L protein, a previously isolated human homologue of Drosophila ISWI.
This gene, designated SMARCA5, contained an open reading frame of 3,156 nucleotides encoding a 1,052 amino-acid peptide (hSNF2H).
Northern-blot analysis demonstrated ubiquitous expression of 5.1-kb and 4.1-kb transcripts of the hSNF2H gene.
