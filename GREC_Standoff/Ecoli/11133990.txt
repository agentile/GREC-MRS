The arc two-component signal transduction system inhibits in vitro Escherichia coli chromosomal initiation. 
Under anaerobic growth conditions, Escherichia coli operates a two-component signal transduction system, termed Arc, that consists of ArcB protein, a transmembrane sensor kinase and ArcA protein, the cognate response regulator. In response to low oxygen levels, autophosphorylated ArcB phosphorylates ArcA, and the resulting phosphorylated ArcA (ArcA-P) functions as a transcriptional regulator of the genes necessary to maintain anaerobic growth. Under anaerobic conditions, cells maintain a slow growth rate, suggesting that the initiation of chromosomal replication is regulated to reduce the initiation frequency. DNase I footprinting experiments revealed that ArcA-P binds to the left region of the chromosomal origin, oriC. ArcA-P did not affect the in vitro replication of plasmid DNA containing the ColE1 origin nor the in vitro replication of viral DNAs; however, ArcA-P specifically inhibited in vitro E. coli chromosomal replication. This inhibition was caused by the prevention of open complex formation, a necessary step in the initiation of chromosomal replication. Our in vitro results suggest that the Arc two-component system participates in regulating chromosomal initiation under anaerobic growth conditions.
