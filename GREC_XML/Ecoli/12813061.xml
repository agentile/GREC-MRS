<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">Transcription profile microarray analysis in Escherichia coli was performed to identify the member genes of the Mg(2+) stimulon that respond to the availability of external Mg(2+) in a PhoP/PhoQ two-component system-dependent manner.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">The mRNA levels of W3110 in the presence of 30 mM MgCl(2), WP3022 (phoP defective), and WQ3007 (phoQ defective) were compared with those of W3110 in the absence of MgCl(2).</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">The expression ratios of a total of 232 genes were &lt;0.75 in all three strains (the supplemental data are shown at http://www.nara.kindai.ac.jp/nogei/seiken/array.html), suggesting that <term sem="SPAN" id="T1" lex="the_PhoP/PhoQ_system">the PhoP/PhoQ system</term> is involved <term sem="SPAN" id="T2" lex="directly">directly</term> or <term sem="SPAN" id="T3" lex="indirectly">indirectly</term> in the transcription of <term sem="Gene" id="T4" lex="these_genes">these genes</term>.</sentence>

<sentence id="S6">Of those, 26 contained the PhoP box-like sequences with the direct repeats of (T/G)GTTTA within 500 bp upstream of the initiation codon.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">Furthermore, S1 nuclease assays of 26 promoters were performed to verify six new Mg(2+) stimulon genes, hemL, nagA, rstAB, slyB, vboR, and yrbL, in addition to the phoPQ, mgrB, and mgtA genes reported previously.</sentence>

<sentence id="S9">Thus, we concluded that the phoPQ, mgrB, mgtA, hemL, nagA, rstAB, slyB, vboR, and yrbL genes make up the Mg(2+) stimulon in E. coli.</sentence>
