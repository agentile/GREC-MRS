Transcriptional regulation in response to oxygen and nitrate of the operons encoding the [NiFe] hydrogenases 1 and 2 of Escherichia coli. 
Synthesis of the [NiFe] hydrogenases 1 and 2 of Escherichia coli is induced in response to anaerobiosis and is repressed when nitrate is present in the growth medium. The hydrogenase 1 and hydrogenase 2 enzymes are encoded by the polycistronic hyaABCDEF and hybOABCDEFG operons, respectively. Primer extension analysis was used to determine the initiation site of transcription of both operons. This permitted the construction of single-copy lacZ operon fusions, which were used to examine the transcriptional regulation of the two operons. Expression of both was induced by anaerobiosis and repressed by nitrate, which is in complete accord with earlier biochemical studies. Anaerobic induction of the hyb operon was only partially dependent on the FNR protein and, surprisingly, was enhanced by an arcA mutation. This latter result indicated that ArcA suppresses anaerobic hyb expression and that a further factor, which remains to be identified, is involved in controlling anaerobic induction of operon expression. Nitrate repression of hyb expression was mediated by the NarL/NarX and NarP/NarQ two-component regulatory systems. Remarkably, a narP mutant lacked anaerobic induction of hyb expression, even in the absence of added nitrate. Anaerobic induction of hya expression was dependent on the ArcA and AppY regulators, which confirms earlier observations by other authors. Nitrate repression of the hya operon was mediated by both NarL and NarP. Taken together, these data indicate that although the hya and hyb operons share common regulators, there are important differences in the control of expression of the individual operons.
