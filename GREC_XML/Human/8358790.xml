<sentence id="S1">Bcl-2 heterodimerizes in vivo with a conserved homolog, Bax, that accelerates programmed cell death.</sentence>

<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">Bcl-2 protein is able to repress a number of apoptotic death programs.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">To investigate the mechanism of Bcl-2's effect, we examined whether Bcl-2 interacted with other proteins.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">We identified an associated 21 kd protein partner, Bax, that has extensive amino acid homology with Bcl-2, focused within highly conserved domains I and II.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6"><term sem="Protein" id="T1" lex="Bax">Bax</term> is encoded by <term sem="DNA" id="T2" lex="six_exons">six exons</term> and demonstrates a complex pattern of alternative RNA splicing that predicts a 21 kd membrane (alpha) and two forms of cytosolic protein (beta and gamma).</sentence>

<clue>Bax is <clueType>encoded</clueType> by six exons and demonstrates a complex pattern of alternative RNA splicing that predicts a 21 kd membrane (alpha) and two forms of cytosolic protein (beta and gamma).</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S7">Bax homodimerizes and forms heterodimers with Bcl-2 in vivo.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">Overexpressed Bax accelerates apoptotic death induced by cytokine deprivation in an IL-3-dependent cell line.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">Overexpressed Bax also counters the death repressor activity of Bcl-2.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">These data suggest a model in which the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax determines survival or death following an apoptotic stimulus.</sentence>
