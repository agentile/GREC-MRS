<sentence id="S3">High expression in Escherichia coli of the lux system cistron of a luminous bacteria under its own control has been accomplished only for the Vibrio fischeri lux system at high cell density.</sentence>

<sentence id="S5">The E. coli double mutant, MC4110 hns::kan rpoS::tet carrying the lux system of V. fischeri, developed high luminescence from the very early stages of cellular growth, regardless of the presence of deletion mutations in the luxI or luxR genes.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">Moreover, autoinducer synthesis was restored in the double mutant with the luxR-deleted system.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">plac-controlled V. fischeri luxCDABE genes missing luxI and luxR were dim in E. coli rpoS mutant cells, but had wild-type levels of light in the hns-deleted strain [MC4110 hns rpoS], showing that expression was independent of lux regulators in the absence of H-NS.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">DNA gyrase inhibitors and DNA intercalating agents also brought about the restoration of luminescence in the rpoS-deficient strain.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">High expression of the lux systems of Vibrio harveyi, Photobacterium leiognathi, and Xenorhabdus luminescens in E. coli MC4110 hns rpoS cells compared with that in wild-type or rpoS mutants was also accomplished.</sentence>
