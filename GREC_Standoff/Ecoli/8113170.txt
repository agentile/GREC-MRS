A distant upstream site involved in the negative regulation of the Escherichia coli ompF gene. 
The two-component regulatory system, OmpR-EnvZ, of Escherichia coli K-12 regulates the expression of the major outer membrane porin protein, OmpF. OmpR is a DNA-binding protein which acts as both an activator and a repressor to control ompF transcription. In this article, we describe a new OmpR-binding site that is located between 384 to 351 bp upstream from the ompF start point of transcription. Inactivation of this site by insertion of a 22-bp fragment prevents the repression of ompF expression conferred by the dominant negative mutation, envZ473. On the basis of the location of this binding site, the presence of bent DNA in the ompF regulatory region (T. Mizuno, Gene 54:57-64, 1987), and the fact that mutations altering integration host factor result in constitutive ompF expression (P. Tsui, V. Helu, and M. Freundlich, J. Bacteriol. 170:4950-4953, 1988), we propose that the negative regulation of ompF involves a DNA loop structure.
