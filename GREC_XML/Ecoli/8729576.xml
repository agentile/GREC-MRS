<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">As an advanced molecular study of the problems of the evolution of organisms, the transcriptional regulation system is studied by investigating the amino acid sequence similarities between the proteins in the regulation system of Escherichia coli in which the data of sequenced proteins as well as of regulator-regulon relationships are accumulated.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">The similarities between the proteins are calculated by the FASTA algorithm and their homology is also evaluated in terms of statistical significance with the use of the RDF2 program.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">This investigation reveals that the similarity between the regulatory protein and the regulated protein is hardly found, but many similarities are found between regulatory proteins and between regulated proteins.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">These similarity relations are compared with the regulator-regulon relationships ascertained experimentally.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">From this comparison, it is found that <term sem="Regulator" id="T4" lex="similar_regulatory_proteins">similar regulatory proteins</term> <term sem="SPAN" id="T5" lex="rarely">rarely</term> regulate the transcription of <term sem="Gene" id="T6" lex="similar_protein_genes">similar protein genes</term>.</sentence>
