<sentence id="S3">The lambda phage choice between lysis and lysogeny is influenced by certain host functions in Escherichia coli.</sentence>

<clue>The ftsH gene, previously shown to <clueType>code</clueType> for an essential inner membrane protein with putative ATPase activity, is identical to hflB, a gene involved in the stability of the phage cII activator protein.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S6">The lysogenic decision controlled by FtsH/HflB is independent of that controlled by the protease HflA.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">Overproduction of FtsH/HflB suppresses the high frequency of lysogenization in an hflA null mutant.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">The FtsH/HflB protein, which stimulates cII degradation, may be a component of an HflA-independent proteolytic pathway, or it may act as a chaperone, maintaining cII in a conformation subject to proteolysis via such a pathway.</sentence>
