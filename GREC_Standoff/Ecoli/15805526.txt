Catabolite repression of the propionate catabolic genes in Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica: evidence for involvement of the cyclic AMP receptor protein. 
Previous studies with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 demonstrated that transcriptional activation of the prpBCDE operon requires the function of transcription factor PrpR, sigma-54, and IHF. In this study, we found that transcription from the prpBCDE and prpR promoters was down-regulated by the addition of glucose or glycerol, indicating that these genes may be regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. Targeted mutagenesis of a putative CRP-binding site in the promoter region between prpR and prpBCDE suggested that these genes are under the control of CRP. Furthermore, cells with defects in cya or crp exhibited reduced transcriptional activation of prpR and prpBCDE in Escherichia coli. These results demonstrate that propionate metabolism is subject to catabolite repression by the global transcriptional regulator CRP and that this regulation is effected through control of both the regulator gene prpR and the prpBCDE operon itself. The unique properties of the regulation of these two divergent promoters may have important implications for mechanisms of CRP-dependent catabolite repression acting in conjunction with a member of the sigma-54 family of transcriptional activators.
