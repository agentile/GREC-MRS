<clue>The yeiL open reading frame located at 48.5 min (2254 kb) in the nfo-fruA region of the Escherichia coli chromosome was predicted to <clueType>encode</clueType> a CRP and FNR paralogue capable of forming inter- or intra-molecular disulphide bonds and incorporating one iron-sulphur centre per 25 kDa subunit.</clue>

<sentence id="S4">Purified MBP-YeiL (a maltose-binding-protein-YeiL fusion protein) was a high-molecular-mass oligomer or aggregate which released unstable monomers (68 kDa) under reducing conditions.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">The MBP-YeiL protein contained substoichiometric amounts of iron and acid-labile sulphide, and an average of one disulphide bond per monomer.</sentence>
