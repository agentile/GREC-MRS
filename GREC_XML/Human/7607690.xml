<sentence id="S5">To isolate additional alpha genes, degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the runt domain--a region shared by all alpha genes--were used for screening cDNA libraries.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">A 228-bp fragment was isolated from a mouse thymus cDNA library, which showed 82 and 76% DNA sequence identity to the previously isolated murine alpha genes, Cbfa1 and Cbfa2.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">This novel alpha gene was named Cbfa3.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">The corresponding sequence from the human homolog CBFA3 was obtained by cosmid cloning and sequencing of the appropriate restriction fragment.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">The corresponding regions of mouse Cbfa3 and human CBFA3 show 91% nucleotide identity and 100% protein identity.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">In situ hybridization and physical mapping of somatic cell hybrids localized CBFA3 to chromosome 1p35-pter.</sentence>
