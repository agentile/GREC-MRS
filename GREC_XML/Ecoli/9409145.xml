<clue>The ArC/XylS family of prokaryotic positive transcriptional regulators includes more than 100 proteins and polypeptides <clueType>derived</clueType> from open reading frames translated from DNA sequences.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S4">Members of this family are widely distributed and have been found in the gamma subgroup of the proteobacteria, low- and high-G + C-content gram-positive bacteria, and cyanobacteria.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">These proteins are defined by a profile that can be accessed from PROSITE PS01124.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">Members of the family are about 300 amino acids long and have three main regulatory functions in common: carbon metabolism, stress response, and pathogenesis.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">Multiple alignments of the proteins of the family define a conserved stretch of 99 amino acids usually located at the C-terminal region of the regulator and connected to a nonconserved region via a linker.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8"><term sem="DNA" id="T3" lex="The_conserved_stretch">The conserved stretch</term> contains <term sem="SPAN" id="T4" lex="all_the_elements">all the elements</term> required to bind <term sem="SPAN" id="T5" lex="DNA_target_sequences">DNA target sequences</term> and to activate transcription from <term sem="Promoter" id="T6" lex="cognate_promoters">cognate promoters</term>.</sentence>

<sentence id="S9">Secondary analysis of the conserved region suggests that it contains two potential alpha-helix-turn-alpha-helix DNA binding motifs.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">The first, and better-fitting motif is supported by biochemical data, whereas existing biochemical data neither support nor refute the proposal that the second region possesses this structure.</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">The phylogenetic relationship suggests that members of the family have recruited the nonconserved domain(s) into a series of existing domains involved in DNA recognition and transcription stimulation and that this recruited domain governs the role that the regulator carries out.</sentence>
<sentence id="S12">For some regulators, it has been demonstrated that the nonconserved region contains the dimerization domain.</sentence>
<sentence id="S13">For the regulators involved in carbon metabolism, the effector binding determinants are also in this region.</sentence>
