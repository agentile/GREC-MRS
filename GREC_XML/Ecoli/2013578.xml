<sentence id="S3">We have cloned at least 12 different Escherichia coli genes which enable strain MK2001 to use maltose.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">The genes were designated sfs1 through sfs12 (sugar fermentation stimulation).</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Previously, one (sfs7) of them was mapped at 65 min on the E. coli chromosome and identified as nlp, which has high homology to repressor protein (Ner) of Mu phage, which contains a putative DNA binding region (Y.-L. Choi, T. Nishida, M. Kawamukai, R. Utsumi, H. Sakai, and T. Komano, J. Bacteriol. 171:5222-5225, 1989).</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">In this study, another gene (sfs1) located at 3.5 min was newly found and analyzed.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">The nucleotide sequence of <term sem="Gene" id="T6" lex="sfs1">sfs1</term> encoded <term sem="Protein" id="T7" lex="a_protein">a protein</term> of 234 amino acids (molecular mass, 26,227 Da) which also has a putative DNA binding domain.</sentence>
