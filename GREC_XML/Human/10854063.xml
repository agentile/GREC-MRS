<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">Prothymosin alpha and parathymosin are two ubiquitous small acidic nuclear proteins that are thought to be involved in cell cycle progression, proliferation, and cell differentiation.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">In an effort to investigate the molecular function of the two proteins, we studied their spatial distribution by indirect immunofluorescence labeling and confocal scanning laser microscopy in relation to nuclear components involved in transcription, translation, and splicing.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Results indicate that both proteins exhibit a punctuated nuclear distribution and are excluded by nucleoli.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">The distribution of prothymosin alpha in the nucleus is related to that of transcription sites, whereas the distribution of parathymosin correlates with early replication sites.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">This implies that <term sem="SPAN" id="T5" lex="prothymosin_alpha">prothymosin alpha</term> and <term sem="SPAN" id="T6" lex="parathymosin">parathymosin</term> are involved in <term sem="Transcription" id="T7" lex="transcription">transcription</term> and <term sem="SPAN" id="T8" lex="replication">replication</term>, respectively.</sentence>
<event id="E3">
<type class="GRE" />
<Theme idref="T5" idref1="T6" />
<Descriptive-Theme idref="T7" />
<clue>This implies that prothymosin alpha and parathymosin are <clueType>involved</clueType> in transcription and replication, respectively.</clue>
</event>

<type class="GRE" />
<Theme idref="T5" idref1="T6" />
<Descriptive-Theme idref="T8" />
<clue>This implies that prothymosin alpha and parathymosin are <clueType>involved</clueType> in transcription and replication, respectively.</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S8">In addition to the punctate distribution, prothymosin alpha also is found concentrated in 1-6 nuclear domains per cell.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">These domains are found in more than 80% of randomly growing T24 human bladder carcinoma cells.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">They have a diameter of 0.2-2.5 microm, their size being inversely related to the number of domains per cell.</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">The domains disappear during mitosis and the protein is excluded from the metaphase chromosomes.</sentence>
<sentence id="S12">Double-labeling experiments associate these prothymosin alpha domains with PML and CstF64 containing nuclear bodies, but not with hnRNP-I containing domains or coiled bodies.</sentence>
