<sentence id="S4">We have now characterized the genomic structure, chromosome location, promoter, and expression pattern of the factor.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">Genes for the murine and human mRNAs contained 16 and 15 exons, respectively.</sentence>
<sentence id="S6">Both genes spanned approximately 30 kilobases of chromosomal DNA, and among coding exons, all exon/intron boundaries were conserved.</sentence>
<sentence id="S7">The human gene for CP2 was found to reside on chromosome 12 while the murine gene mapped to the distal end of chromosome 15, near Gdc-1, Wnt-1, and Rarg, a region syntenic with human chromosome 12.</sentence>
<sentence id="S8">The murine and human promoters initiated mRNAs at multiple start sites in a conserved region that spanned more than 450 nucleotides.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">Lastly, a study of the pattern of <term sem="SPAN" id="T7" lex="CP2_gene">CP2 gene</term> expression showed that <term sem="SPAN" id="T8" lex="the_factor">the factor</term> was expressed <term sem="SPAN" id="T9" lex="in_all_adult_and_fetal_murine_tissues">in <term sem="Tissue" id="T10" lex="all_adult_and_fetal_murine_tissues">all adult and fetal murine tissues</term></term> examined from at least day 9.5 of development.</sentence>
