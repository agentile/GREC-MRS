<sentence id="S1">Regulation of pyelonephritis-associated pili phase-variation in Escherichia coli: binding of the PapI and the Lrp regulatory proteins is controlled by DNA methylation.</sentence>

<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">Expression of pyelonephritis-associated pili (Pap) in Escherichia coli is under a phase-variation control mechanism in which individual cells alternate between pili+ (ON) and pili- (OFF) states through a process involving DNA methylation by deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam).</sentence>
