Complementation analysis of the wild-type and mutant ompR genes exhibiting different phenotypes of osmoregulation of the ompF and ompC genes of Escherichia coli. 
Expression of the ompF and ompC genes, which encode the major outer membrane proteins, OmpF and OmpC, respectively, is affected in a reciprocal manner by the osmolarity of the growth medium. This osmoregulation is mediated by the OmpR protein, a positive regulator of both genes, which is encoded by the ompR gene. Structural and functional properties of this regulatory protein were studied through complementation analysis of the wild-type and five mutant ompR genes that exhibited differences in osmoregulation of the expression of the OmpF and OmpC proteins. Complementation was carried out with combinations of a host strain and a plasmid, each of which carried either the wild-type or a mutant ompR gene. In some combinations, negative complementation was observed. For example, ompR1, a deletion mutation with an OmpF- OmpC- phenotype, was dominant to OmpF+ or OmpC+ phenotypes conferred by other ompR genes. Positive complementation of two mutant ompR genes was also observed in other combinations, when the two mutations were distantly located from each other on the OmpR protein. These results, together with other observations, support the view that the OmpR protein has a two-domain structure, each domain exhibiting a different role in the expression of the OmpF and OmpC proteins, and that this protein takes a multimeric structure as a functional unit.
