Nucleotide sequence and characterization of the sfs1 gene: sfs1 is involved in CRP*-dependent mal gene expression in Escherichia coli. 
We have cloned at least 12 different Escherichia coli genes which enable strain MK2001 to use maltose. The genes were designated sfs1 through sfs12 (sugar fermentation stimulation). Previously, one (sfs7) of them was mapped at 65 min on the E. coli chromosome and identified as nlp, which has high homology to repressor protein (Ner) of Mu phage, which contains a putative DNA binding region (Y.-L. Choi, T. Nishida, M. Kawamukai, R. Utsumi, H. Sakai, and T. Komano, J. Bacteriol. 171:5222-5225, 1989). In this study, another gene (sfs1) located at 3.5 min was newly found and analyzed. The nucleotide sequence of sfs1 encoded a protein of 234 amino acids (molecular mass, 26,227 Da) which also has a putative DNA binding domain. Overexpression of the sfs1 gene in MK2001 resulted in a 10-fold increase of amylomaltase, which was still dependent on MalT. These results suggest that Sfs1 could be a new regulatory factor involved in maltose metabolism.
