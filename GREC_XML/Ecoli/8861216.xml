<sentence id="S3">The Salmonella typhimurium protein SlyA(ST), originally described as a cytolysin, shows sequence similarities to several known bacterial regulatory proteins.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">A homologue to the Slya(ST) gene has been localised to min 37 of the Escherichia coil K-12 chromosome and has been designated SlyA(EC).</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">When introduced in trans on a plasmid, the SlyA(EC) gene conferred a haemolytic phenotype on wild-type but not clyA-knockout strains of E. coli K-12.</sentence>
