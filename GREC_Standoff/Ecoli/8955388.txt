Action at a distance for negative control of transcription of the glpD gene encoding sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of Escherichia coli K-12. 
Aerobic sn-glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is a cytoplasmic membrane-associated respiratory enzyme encoded by the glpD gene of Escherichia coli. The glpD operon is tightly controlled by cooperative binding of the glp repressor to tandem operators (O(D)1 and O(D)2) that cover the -10 promoter element and 30 bp downstream of the transcription start site. In this work, two additional operators were identified within the glpD structural gene at positions 568 to 587 (0(D)3) and 609 to 628 (0(D)4). The two internal operators bound the glp repressor in the presence or absence of the tandem operators (O(D)1 and O(D)2) in vitro, as shown by DNase I footprinting. To assess a potential regulatory role for the two internal operators in vivo, a glpD-lacZ transcriptional fusion containing all four operators was constructed. The response of this fusion to the glp repressor was compared with those of fusion constructs in which O(D)3 and O(D)4 were inactivated by either deletion or site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that the repression conferred by binding of the glp repressor to O(D)1 and O(D)2 was increased five- to sevenfold upon introduction of the internal operators. A regulatory role for HU was suggested when it was found that repressor-mediated control of glpD transcription was increased fourfold in strains containing HU compared with that of strains deficient in HU. The effect of HU was apparent only in the presence of all four glpD operators. The results suggest that glpD is controlled by formation of a repression loop between the tandem and internal operators. HU may assist repression by bending the DNA to facilitate loop formation.
