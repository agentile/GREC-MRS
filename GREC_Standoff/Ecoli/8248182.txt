Cell growth and lambda phage development controlled by the same essential Escherichia coli gene, ftsH/hflB. 
The lambda phage choice between lysis and lysogeny is influenced by certain host functions in Escherichia coli. We found that the frequency of lambda lysogenization is markedly increased in the ftsH1 temperature-sensitive mutant. The ftsH gene, previously shown to code for an essential inner membrane protein with putative ATPase activity, is identical to hflB, a gene involved in the stability of the phage cII activator protein. The lysogenic decision controlled by FtsH/HflB is independent of that controlled by the protease HflA. Overproduction of FtsH/HflB suppresses the high frequency of lysogenization in an hflA null mutant. The FtsH/HflB protein, which stimulates cII degradation, may be a component of an HflA-independent proteolytic pathway, or it may act as a chaperone, maintaining cII in a conformation subject to proteolysis via such a pathway.
