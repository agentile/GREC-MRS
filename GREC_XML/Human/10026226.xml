<sentence id="S1">Skeletal muscle type ryanodine receptor is involved in calcium signaling in human B lymphocytes.</sentence>

<Abstract>
<AbstractText>
<sentence id="S3">The regulation of intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in B cells remains poorly understood and is presently explained almost solely by inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3)-mediated Ca2+ release, followed by activation of a store-operated channel mechanism.</sentence>
<sentence id="S4">In fact, there are reports indicating that IP3 production does not always correlate with the magnitude of Ca2+ release.</sentence>
<sentence id="S5">We demonstrate here that <term sem="Cells" id="T1" lex="human_B_cells">human B cells</term> express a ryanodine receptor (<term sem="SPAN" id="T2" lex="RYR">RYR</term>) that functions as <term sem="SPAN" id="T3" lex="a_Ca2+_release_channel">a Ca2+ release channel</term> <term sem="SPAN" id="T4" lex="during_the_B_cell_antigen_receptor_(BCR)-stimulated_Ca2+_signaling_process">during the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-stimulated Ca2+ signaling process</term>.</sentence>

<clue>Selective reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphism, and sequencing of cloned cDNA indicated that the major isoform of the RYR <clueType>expressed</clueType> in primary CD19(+) B and DAKIKI cells is identical to the skeletal muscle type (RYR1).</clue>
</event>
<sentence id="S8">Saturation analysis of [3H]ryanodine binding yielded Bmax = 150 fmol/mg of protein and Kd = 110 nM in DAKIKI cells.</sentence>
<sentence id="S9">In fluo-3-loaded CD19(+) B and DAKIKI cells, 4-chloro-m-cresol, a potent activator of Ca2+ release mediated by the ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel, induced Ca2+ release in a dose-dependent and ryanodine-sensitive fashion.</sentence>
<sentence id="S10">Furthermore, BCR-mediated Ca2+ release in CD19(+) B cells was significantly altered by 4-chloro-m-cresol and ryanodine.</sentence>
<sentence id="S11">These results indicate that RYR1 functions as a Ca2+ release channel during BCR-stimulated Ca2+ signaling and suggest that complex Ca2+ signals that control the cellular activities of B cells may be generated by cooperation of the IP3 receptor and RYR1.</sentence>
