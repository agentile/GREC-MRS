The gene encoding the periplasmic cyclophilin homologue, PPIase A, in Escherichia coli, is expressed from four promoters, three of which are activated by the cAMP-CRP complex and negatively regulated by the CytR repressor. 
The rot gene in Escherichia coli encodes PPIase A, a periplasmic peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase with homology to the cyclophilin family of proteins. Here it is demonstrated that rot is expressed in a complex manner from four overlapping promoters and that the rot regulatory region is unusually compact, containing a close array of sites for DNA-binding proteins. The three most upstream rot promoters are activated by the global gene regulatory cAMP-CRP complex and negatively regulated by the CytR repressor protein. Activation of these three promoters occurs by binding of cAMP-CRP to two sites separated by 53 bp. Moreover, one of the cAMP-CRP complexes is involved in the activation of both a Class I and a Class II promoter. Repression takes place by the formation of a CytR/cAMP-CRP/DNA nucleoprotein complex consisting of the two cAMP-CRP molecules and CytR bound in between. The two regulators bind co-operatively to the DNA overlapping the three upstream promoters, simultaneously quenching the cAMP-CRP activator function. These results expand the CytR regulon to include a gene whose product has no known function in ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside catabolism or transport.
